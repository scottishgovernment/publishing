            <p>This would include cases where a tenant has not paid all of the rent payable, any amount in respect of one-off services, or unpaid utility bills, or a sum in relation to breakages or cleaning.</p>

            <p>At the end of the tenancy the Landlord should ask the tenancy deposit scheme to release the deposit and the amounts payable to each party. If the Tenant disagrees with the amount, the scheme administrator will provide a dispute resolution mechanism.</p>

            <p>Where the Tenant owes the Landlord an amount greater than the amount held by the tenancy deposit scheme, the Tenant will remain liable for these costs, and the Landlord may take action to recover the difference from the Tenant.</p>

            <h3>THE REPAIRING STANDARD</h3>

            <p>The Landlord is responsible for ensuring that the Let Property meets the Repairing Standard.</p>

            <p>The Landlord must carry out a pre-tenancy check of the Let Property to identify work required to meet the Repairing Standard (described below) and notify the Tenant of any such work. The Landlord also has a duty to repair and maintain the Let Property from the start date of the tenancy and throughout the tenancy. This includes a duty to make good any damage caused by doing this work. On becoming aware of a defect, the Landlord must complete the work within a reasonable time.</p>

            <p>A privately rented Let Property must meet the Repairing Standard as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The house meets the Tolerable Standard, including <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/tolerable-standard-guidance-satisfactory-fire-carbon-monoxide-detection/">satisfactory fire and carbon monoxide detection</a>.</li>
                <li>The Let Property must be wind and water tight and in all other respects reasonably fit for people to live in.</li>
                <li>The structure and exterior (including drains, gutters and external pipes) must be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper working order.</li>
                <li>Installations for supplying water, gas and electricity and for sanitation, space heating and heating water must be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper working order.</li>
                <li>Any fixtures, fittings and appliances that the Landlord provides under the tenancy must be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper working order.</li>
                <li>Any furnishings that the Landlord provides under the tenancy must be capable of being used safely for the purpose for which they are designed.</li>
                <li>The Let Property must have satisfactory provision for, and safe access to a food storage area and a food preparation space.</li>
                <li>Common parts pertaining to the house can be safely accessed and used.</li>
                <li>Where a house is in a tenement, common doors are secure and fitted with satisfactory emergency exit locks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>More detail on the Repairing Standard is available in the Easy Read Notes for the Scottish Government Model Private Residential Tenancy Agreement, or on the Scottish Government website. If the Tenant believes that the Landlord has failed to ensure that the Let Property meets the Repairing Standard at all times during the tenancy, he or she should discuss this with the Landlord in the first instance. If the Landlord does not rectify the problem within a reasonable time, the Tenant has the right to apply to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber (&ldquo;the Tribunal&rdquo;). The Tribunal may reject the application; consider whether the case can be resolved by the Tenant and Landlord (for example, by agreeing to mediation); consider the application; or reject the case. The Tribunal has power to require a Landlord to carry out work necessary to meet the Repairing Standard.</p>

            <p>The Repairing Standard does not cover work for which the Tenant is responsible due to his or her duty to use the Let Property in a proper manner; nor does it cover the repair or maintenance of anything that the Tenant is entitled to remove from the Let Property.</p>

            <p>Structure &amp; exterior:</p>

            <p>The Landlord is responsible (together with any other owners of common parts of the building in which the accommodation is situated, if appropriate) for keeping in repair the structure and exterior of the accommodation.</p>

            <p>Gas safety:</p>

            <p>The Landlord must ensure that there is an annual Gas safety check on all pipework and appliances carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer. The Tenant must be given a copy of the Landlord&rsquo;s gas safety certificate. The Landlord must keep certificates for at least 2 years. The Gas Safety (Installation and use) Regulations 1998 places duties on Tenants to report any defects with gas pipework or gas appliances that they are aware of to the Landlord. Tenants are forbidden to use appliances that have been deemed unsafe by a gas contractor.</p>

            <p>The Landlord must also ensure that a carbon monoxide detector is installed where there is a fixed carbon-fuelled appliance ( excluding an appliance used solely for cooking ) or where a fixed carbon-fuelled appliance is situated in an inter-connected space such as a garage. A carbon monoxide detector is also required in the bedrooms and main living room if a flue from a carbon-fuelled appliance passes through the room. &ldquo;Carbon-fuelled&rdquo; includes wood, coal and oil as well as gas.</p>

            <p>Tenants must be advised of the following action to be taken should there be a smell of gas, or suspicion of a gas escape, or a carbon monoxide leak:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Open all doors and windows;</li>
                <li>Shut off the gas supply at the meter control valve;</li>
                <li>If gas continues to escape the National Gas Emergency Service should be called on 0800 111 999 &mdash; it operates 24 hours a day; and</li>
                <li>Any investigations or repairs must be carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Electrical safety:</p>

            <p>The Landlord must ensure that an electrical safety inspection is carried out at least every five years consisting of an Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) and Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) on appliances provided by the Landlord. The EICR must be completed by a suitably competent person.</p>

            <p>The Tenant must be given a copy of the EICR and any PAT.</p>

            <p>Installations:</p>

            <p>The Landlord will keep in repair and in proper working order the installations in the Let Property for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, space heating and water heating (with the exception of those installed by the Tenant or which the Tenant is entitled to remove).</p>

            <p>Energy Performance Certificate (EPC):</p>

            <p>A valid EPC (not more than 10 years old) must be given to the Tenant at the start date of the tenancy, unless the Tenant is renting a room with shared access to a kitchen, bathroom and living area.</p>

            <p>Furnishings:</p>

            <p>Landlords should ensure that all upholstered furniture provided complies with the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire Safety) Regulations 1988 as amended, as evidenced by the permanent labelling. </p>

            <p>Defective fixtures and fittings:</p>

            <p>All fixtures and fittings provided by the Landlord in the Let Property should be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper working order. The Landlord will repair or replace any of the fixtures, fittings or furnishings supplied which become defective and will do so within a reasonable period of time. Nothing contained in this Agreement makes the Landlord responsible for repairing damage caused wilfully or negligently by the Tenant, anyone living with the Tenant or an invited visitor to the Let Property.</p>

            <p>Food storage and preparation:</p>

            <p>Landlords must ensure that the tenant can safely access food storage and food preparation space. This includes appropriate space to store food, as well as space and an appropriate power source for the installation of a fridge and freezer or a fridge/freezer. The food preparation space must be appropriate and set out in a way that allows it to be used safely.</p>

            <p>Access to common parts:</p>

            <p>Landlords must ensure that any common parts pertaining to the house can be safely accessed and used. In relation to the obstructions and cleanliness of common areas, landlords are entitled to expect tenants to store possessions such as bicycles and pushchairs appropriately and dispose of rubbish properly, but if necessary items may have to be removed.</p>

            <p>Tenements and common doors:</p>

            <p>Where a house is in a tenement and has common doors (or is designed to have common doors), the Landlord must ensure that these doors are secure and fitted with satisfactory emergency exit locks.</p>

            <h3>REPAIR TIMETABLE</h3>

            <p>The Tenant undertakes to notify the Landlord as soon as is reasonably practicable of the need for any repair or emergency. The Landlord is responsible for carrying out necessary repairs as soon as is reasonably practicable after having been notified of the need to do so.</p>

            <p>The Tenant must allow the Landlord reasonable access to the Let Property to enable the Landlord to fulfil their duties under the repairing standard (see the clause on &lsquo;Access for Repairs&rsquo;).</p>

            <h3>PAYMENT FOR REPAIRS</h3>

            <p>The Tenant will be liable for the cost of repairs where the need for them is attributable to his or her fault or negligence, that of any person residing with him or her, or any guest of his or hers.</p>

            <h3>INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>In addition to this Agreement, the Landlord must give to the Tenant:-</p>

            <ul>
                <li>gas safety certificate;</li>
                <li>electrical safety inspection reports;</li>
                <li>energy performance certificate (unless the Tenant is renting a room with shared access to a kitchen, bathroom and living area).</li>

            <p>&ldquo;Anti-social behaviour&rdquo; means behaving in a way which causes, or is likely to cause, alarm, distress, nuisance or annoyance to any person; or which amounts to harassment of any person; or causes damage to anyone&rsquo;s property.

            <p>This Tenancy may be ended by:-</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Tenant giving notice to the Landlord

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Tenant giving the Landlord at least 28 days&rsquo; notice in writing to terminate the tenancy, or an earlier date if the Landlord is content to waive the minimum 28 day notice period. Where the Landlord agrees to waive the notice period, his or her agreement must be in writing. The tenancy will come to an end on the date specified in the notice or, where appropriate, the earlier date agreed between the Tenant and Landlord. To end a joint tenancy, all the Joint Tenants must agree to end the tenancy. One Joint Tenant cannot terminate the joint tenancy on behalf of all Joint Tenants.</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>

                <li>The Landlord giving notice to the Tenant, which is only possible using one of the 18 grounds for eviction set out in schedule 3 of the Act. This can happen either:-

                    <ul>
                        <li>By the Landlord giving the Tenant a Notice to Leave stating one or more of the eviction grounds, and the Tenant choosing to leave. In this case, the tenancy will come to an end on the day specified in the Notice to Leave, or the day on which the Tenant actually leaves the Let Property, whichever is the later.</li>

                    or:-

                        <li>By the Landlord giving the Tenant a Notice to Leave stating one or more of the eviction grounds and then, if the Tenant chooses not to leave on the day after the notice period expires, subsequently obtaining an eviction order from the Tribunal on the stated eviction ground(s). In this case, the tenancy will come to an end on the date specified in the eviction order. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Landlord can bring the tenancy to an end only if one of the 18 grounds for eviction apply. If the Landlord serves a Notice to Leave on the Tenant, he or she must specify which eviction ground(s) is being used, and give the reasons why they believe this eviction ground applies.</p>

            <p>If the Landlord applies to the Tribunal for an eviction order, the Tribunal will ask the Landlord to provide supporting evidence for any eviction ground(s) being used.</p>

            <p>The amount of notice a Landlord must give the Tenant will depend on which eviction ground is being used by the Landlord and how long the Tenant has lived in the Let Property.</p>

            <p>The Landlord must give the Tenant at least 28 days&rsquo; notice if, on the day the Tenant receives the Notice to Leave, the Tenant has been entitled to occupy the Let Property for six months or less, or if the eviction ground (or grounds) that the Landlord is stating is one or more of the following. The Tenant: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>is not occupying the Let Property as his or her only or principal home</li>
                <li>has breached the tenancy agreement</li>
                <li>is rent arrears for three or more consecutive months</li>
                <li>has a relevant criminal conviction</li>
                <li>has engaged in relevant antisocial behaviour</li>
                <li>has associated with a person who has relevant conviction or has engaged in antisocial behaviour. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Landlord must give the Tenant at least 84 days&rsquo; notice if, on the date the Tenant receives the Notice to Leave, the Tenant has been entitled to occupy the Let Property for over six months and the Notice to Leave does not rely exclusively on one (or more) of the eviction grounds already mentioned in this paragraph. </p>

            <p>The Landlord must secure repossession only by lawful means and must comply with all relevant legislation affecting private residential tenancies.</p>

            <h3>SCHEDULE 3 TO THE ACT &mdash; EVICTION GROUNDS</h3>

            <p>All eviction grounds are discretionary. This means that the First-tier Tribunal (Housing and Property Chamber) are able to exercise discretion and take into account of the circumstances of a case when deciding whether to grant an eviction or not.</p>

            <p>Schedule 3 sets out the 18 grounds under which a Landlord may seek eviction. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Landlord intends to sell the Let Property for market value within three months of the Tenant ceasing to occupy it.</li>
                <li>Let Property to be sold by the mortgage lender.</li>
                <li>The Landlord intends to refurbish and this will entail significantly disruptive works to, or in relation to, the Let Property.</li>
                <li>The Landlord intends to live in the Let Property as his or her only or principal home.</li>
                <li>The Landlord intends to use the Let Property for a purpose other than providing a person with a home.</li>
                <li>The Let Property is held for a person engaged in the work of a religious denomination as a residence from which the duties of such a person are to be performed; the Let Property has previously been used for that purpose; and the Let Property is required for that purpose.</li>
                <li>The Tenant is not occupying the Let Property as his or her only or principal home or has abandoned the Let Property.</li>
                <li>After the start date of the tenancy, the Tenant is convicted of using, or allowing the use of, the Let Property for an immoral or illegal purpose, or is convicted of an imprisonable offence committed in or in the locality of the Let Property. The application must usually be made within 12 months of the Tenant&rsquo;s conviction.</li>
                <li>A member of the Landlord&rsquo;s family intends to live in the Let Property as his or her only or principal home.</li>
                <li>The tenancy was entered into on account of the Tenant having an assessed need for community care and the Tenant has since been assessed as no longer having such need.</li>
                <li>The Tenant has breached the tenancy agreement &mdash; this excludes the payment of rent.</li>
                <li>The Tenant has acted in an anti-social manner to another person and the Tribunal is satisfied that it is reasonable to issue an eviction order given the nature of the behaviour and who it was in relation to or where it occurred. The application must usually be made within 12 months of the antisocial behaviour occurring.</li>
                <li>The Tenant is associating in the Let Property with a person who has a relevant conviction or who has engaged in relevant anti-social behaviour. A relevant conviction is a conviction which, if it was the Tenant&rsquo;s, would entitle the Tribunal to issue an eviction order. Relevant anti-social behaviour means behaviour which, if engaged in by the Tenant, would entitle the Tribunal to issue an eviction order. The application must usually be made within 12 months of the conviction or antisocial behaviour.</li>
                <li>Landlord registration has been refused or revoked by a local authority.</li>
                <li>House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) license revoked by the local authority.</li>
                <li>Overcrowding statutory notice in respect of the let property has been served on the Landlord.</li>
                <li>The Tenant is in rent arrears over three consecutive months. In deciding whether it is reasonable to evict, the Tribunal will consider whether the Tenant being in arrears is due to a delay or failure in the payment of a relevant benefit and the extent the landlord has complied with pre-action requirements for rent arrears are required by The Rent Arrears Pre-Action Requirements (Coronavirus) (Scotland) Regulations 2020.</li>
                <li>The tenancy was granted to an employee and the Tenant is no longer an employee.</li>
