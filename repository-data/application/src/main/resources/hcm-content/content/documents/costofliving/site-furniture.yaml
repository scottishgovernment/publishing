            <p>We're constantly working to make mygov.scot as accessible and usable as possible.</p>
            <p>We do not have a separate accessibility statement. This is because we've tried to be as accessible and usable as possible for all abilities and disabilities, including older audiences and those with visual, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments.</p>
            <h2>Assistive technologies</h2>
            <p>We try and make our site work with various assistive technologies by:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>using easier-to-read colours</li>
            <li>using larger fonts</li>
            <li>using plain english</li>
            <li>allowing navigation using a keyboard only</li>
