          Countries that export have stronger economies.

          <p>Exporting helps Scotland’s economy to grow and creates jobs. It helps the Scottish Government collect more tax to:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>improve living standards</li>
          <li>improve public services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Exporting also helps Scotland build good relationships with other countries. This can help Scotland to have a positive influence on the world.</p>
          <h2>How exporting helps businesses</h2>
          <p>Exporting helps businesses to grow because it:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>leads them to create new products and services</li>
          <li>makes them more productive</li>
          <li>gives them more customers to sell to</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>New products and services</h2>
          <p>Exporting can mean that businesses have more competitors.</p>
          <p>But this can be a positive thing and can lead them to develop new products and services.</p>
          <p>Businesses that export tend to spend more money on research and development. This helps them to develop new products and services to sell.</p>
          <h2>Improving productivity</h2>
          <p>Exporting helps businesses to become more productive. This means they produce more with the same amount of resources.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/">Office of National Statistics</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy">Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</a> say:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>businesses that export make up 60% of the UK’s annual increase in productivity</li>
          <li>the 3% of businesses in Scotland that export are on average 70% more productive than businesses that do not</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>More customers to sell to</h2>
          <p>Exporting also means businesses do not have to rely on a particular set of customers. This helps businesses to spread any risks.</p>
          <p>For example, if sales drop in one market, the risk to their business might be less if they have other markets they sell to.</p>
          <h2>Scotland’s export growth plan</h2>
          <p>Because exporting is important to Scotland and its businesses, the Scottish Government has created an export growth plan. This plan is called <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/">A Trading Nation</a>.</p>

            <p class="ds_leader leader">In 2017, Scotland sold £5.5 billion worth of exports to the United States of America (USA). This is 17.1% of Scotland’s total international exports. Between 2013 and 2017, Scottish exports to the USA increased by an average of 4.6% each year.</p>

            <ul>
             <li>has well defined and established laws</li>
             <li>does not have a lot of regulations which can cause barriers for trade</li>
             <li>has few language barriers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It’s also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>it has a stable, large economy</li>
             <li>UK brands have a good reputation there</li>

          \ these countries are where Scotland's exports are most likely to grow.\
          \ </p> \n  <h2>Countries we’ll look to export to</h2> \n  <p>A Trading Nation\
          \ organises countries into 3 priority groups.</p> \n  <h3>Priority group\
          \ 1</h3> \n  <p>The 15 countries in the first priority group are:</p> \n\
          \  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"usa\">United States of America</a></li> \n  \
          \ <li><a href=\"germany\">Germany</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"france\">France</a></li>\

          \ href=\"spain\">Spain</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>These countries currently\
          \ make up 66% of Scotland’s exports. They’re expected to provide the most\
          \ opportunity for Scotland’s future export growth.</p> \n  <p>To help exports\
          \ to these countries, we’ll put in place support including:</p> \n  <ul>\
          \ \n   <li>Scottish Development International help in each country</li>\
          \ \n   <li>trade envoys for specific sectors</li> \n   <li>help from the\
          \ GlobalScot network</li> \n   <li>help from in-market sector specialists</li>\
          \ \n   <li>trade missions and Ministerial visits</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h3>Priority\
          \ group 2</h3> \n  <p>The 11 countries in the second priority group are:</p>\
          \ \n  <ul> \n   <li>Japan</li> \n   <li>Australia</li> \n   <li>Turkey</li>\
          \ \n   <li>Mexico</li> \n   <li>India</li> \n   <li>Singapore</li> \n  \
          \ <li>United Arab Emirates (UAE)</li> \n   <li>Nigeria</li> \n   <li>South\
          \ Korea</li> \n   <li>Brazil</li> \n   <li>Indonesia</li> \n  </ul> \n \
          \ <p>These countries currently make up 14% of Scotland’s exports. These\
          \ countries are expected to provide opportunities for businesses in:</p>\
          \ \n  <ul> \n   <li>the mid to long term</li> \n   <li>specific sectors</li>\
          \ \n  </ul> \n  <p>To help exports to these countries, we’ll put in place\
          \ support including:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>help from Scottish Development\
          \ International</li> \n   <li>trade envoys for specific sectors</li> \n\
          \   <li>help from the GlobalScot network</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>We’ll also\
          \ look to make use of the Department for International Trade’s support where\
          \ possible.</p> \n  <h3>Priority group 3</h3> \n  <p>The third priority\
          \ group are countries that might offer opportunities for certain Scottish\
          \ businesses.</p> \n  <p>To help exports to these countries, we’ll put in\
          \ place support including help from:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Department for\
          \ International Trade</li> \n   <li>the GlobalScot network</li> \n  </ul>\
          \ \n  <h2>How countries were chosen</h2> \n  <p>Each country was chosen\
          \ based on evidence. This evidence drew on a range of sources that looked\
          \ at:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>how much Scotland currently exports there</li>\
          \ \n   <li>how we think exports there could increase in future</li> \n \
          \  <li>how much other countries are exporting there</li> \n   <li>things\
          \ about that country that can benefit key sectors</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>You\

          >A Trading Nation</a> aims to increase Scotland’s exports by:</p> \n  <ul>\
          \ \n   <li>focussing resources</li> \n   <li>making changes to strategy</li>\
          \ \n   <li>making changes to policy</li> \n   <li>checking how exports perform</li>\
          \ \n  </ul> \n  <h2>Focussing resources</h2> \n  <p>Scotland will increase\
          \ exports by focussing resources where they will have most impact.</p> \n\
          \  <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
          >evidence shows</a> that successful exporting countries:</p> \n  <ul> \n\
          \   <li>focus on a limited range of products and services</li> \n   <li>sell\
          \ to a limited number of countries</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This is why <a\
          \ href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
          >A Trading Nation</a> focusses on <a href=\"index\">key sectors</a> and\
          \ <a href=\"index\">countries</a>.</p> \n  <h2>Top 500 businesses</h2> \n\
          \  <p>Scotland will also focus its resources around its top 500 exporting\
          \ businesses.</p> \n  <p>Scotland currently has around 11,000 businesses\
          \ who export. However, the top 500 are responsible for 80% of exports.</p>\
          \ \n  <p>Increasing exports for the top 500 businesses could add £13 billion\
          \ to Scotland’s economy (Gross Domestic Product), while increasing exports\
          \ in the other 10,500 businesses would only add £2.9 billion.</p> \n  <p>Increasing\
          \ exports for these businesses will also benefit the businesses who supply\
          \ them.</p> \n  <h2>Help for new exporters</h2> \n  <p>All businesses in\
          \ Scotland will still be able to get some <a href=\"help-for-businesses\"\
          >help to grow their business and start exporting</a>. This includes businesses\
          \ who are new to exporting.</p> \n  <p>We’re looking at ways we can deliver\
          \ this help in a different way. For example, improving the help and support\
          \ available online.</p> \n  <h2>Working together</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"\

          >A Trading Nation</a> aims to increase Scotland’s exports by:</p> \n  <ul>\
          \ \n   <li>focussing resources</li> \n   <li>making changes to strategy</li>\
          \ \n   <li>making changes to policy</li> \n   <li>checking how exports perform</li>\
          \ \n  </ul> \n  <h2>Focussing resources</h2> \n  <p>Scotland will increase\
          \ exports by focussing resources where they will have most impact.</p> \n\
          \  <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
          >evidence shows</a> that successful exporting countries:</p> \n  <ul> \n\
          \   <li>focus on a limited range of products and services</li> \n   <li>sell\
          \ to a limited number of countries</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This is why <a\
          \ href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
          >A Trading Nation</a> focusses on <a href=\"index\">key sectors</a> and\
          \ <a href=\"index\">countries</a>.</p> \n  <h2>Top 500 businesses</h2> \n\
          \  <p>Scotland will also focus its resources around its top 500 exporting\
          \ businesses.</p> \n  <p>Scotland currently has around 11,000 businesses\
          \ who export. However, the top 500 are responsible for 80% of exports.</p>\
          \ \n  <p>Increasing exports for the top 500 businesses could add £13 billion\
          \ to Scotland’s economy (Gross Domestic Product), while increasing exports\
          \ in the other 10,500 businesses would only add £2.9 billion.</p> \n  <p>Increasing\
          \ exports for these businesses will also benefit the businesses who supply\
          \ them.</p> \n  <h2>Help for new exporters</h2> \n  <p>All businesses in\
          \ Scotland will still be able to get some <a href=\"help-for-businesses\"\
          >help to grow their business and start exporting</a>. This includes businesses\
          \ who are new to exporting.</p> \n  <p>We’re looking at ways we can deliver\
          \ this help in a different way. For example, improving the help and support\
          \ available online.</p> \n  <h2>Working together</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"\

          >A Trading Nation</a> aims to increase Scotland’s exports by:</p> \n  <ul>\
          \ \n   <li>focussing resources</li> \n   <li>making changes to strategy</li>\
          \ \n   <li>making changes to policy</li> \n   <li>checking how exports perform</li>\
          \ \n  </ul> \n  <h2>Focussing resources</h2> \n  <p>Scotland will increase\
          \ exports by focussing resources where they will have most impact.</p> \n\
          \  <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
          >evidence shows</a> that successful exporting countries:</p> \n  <ul> \n\
          \   <li>focus on a limited range of products and services</li> \n   <li>sell\
          \ to a limited number of countries</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This is why <a\
          \ href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
          >A Trading Nation</a> focusses on <a href=\"index\">key sectors</a> and\
          \ <a href=\"index\">countries</a>.</p> \n  <h2>Top 500 businesses</h2> \n\
          \  <p>Scotland will also focus its resources around its top 500 exporting\
          \ businesses.</p> \n  <p>Scotland currently has around 11,000 businesses\
          \ who export. However, the top 500 are responsible for 80% of exports.</p>\
          \ \n  <p>Increasing exports for the top 500 businesses could add £13 billion\
          \ to Scotland’s economy (Gross Domestic Product), while increasing exports\
          \ in the other 10,500 businesses would only add £2.9 billion.</p> \n  <p>Increasing\
          \ exports for these businesses will also benefit the businesses who supply\
          \ them.</p> \n  <h2>Help for new exporters</h2> \n  <p>All businesses in\
          \ Scotland will still be able to get some <a href=\"help-for-businesses\"\
          >help to grow their business and start exporting</a>. This includes businesses\
          \ who are new to exporting.</p> \n  <p>We’re looking at ways we can deliver\
          \ this help in a different way. For example, improving the help and support\
          \ available online.</p> \n  <h2>Working together</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"\
          https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\">A Trading\
          \ Nation</a> will also focus resources by encouraging organisations to work\
          \ together on the plan’s priorities. This includes:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>the\
          \ Scottish Government</li> \n   <li>the enterprise agencies</li> \n   <li>agencies\
          \ supporting education, tourism and specific industry sectors</li> \n  </ul>\
          \ \n  <p>By working together, it means businesses can make use of:</p> \n\
          \  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/about-sdi/global-offices\"\
          >Scottish Development International offices</a> in 20 countries</li> \n\
          \   <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/policies/international-relations/international-offices/\"\
          >Scottish Government offices</a> in Brussels and 8 other countries</li>\
          \ \n   <li>Visit Scotland offices in London and Toronto</li> \n  </ul> \n\
          \  <p>Businesses will also be able to access wider networks and trade and\
          \ investment specialists across the world. A Trading Nation will use help\
          \ from:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.globalscot.com/\">GlobalScot</a></li>\
          \ \n   <li>trade envoys</li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.scottishchambers.org.uk/\"\

          \ and policy</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
          >A Trading Nation</a> makes changes to strategy and policy.</p> \n  <p>These\
          \ changes aim to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>raise awareness of exporting and\
          \ encourage businesses to see it as an ambition</li> \n   <li>build the\
          \ capacity and capabilities of businesses, so they can take up opportunities</li>\
          \ \n   <li>make sure the right support is available to help businesses expand\
          \ and exploit opportunities</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>To do this, <a href=\"\
          https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\">A Trading\
          \ Nation</a> will:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>improve trade promotion as well\
          \ as Scotland’s overseas profile and reach</li> \n   <li>support businesses\
          \ by refocussing <a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\">Scottish Development\
          \ International’s</a> priorities</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h3>Improving trade\

          >A Trading Nation</a> will:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>expand the <a href=\"\

          \ people in key markets. This includes doubling to 500 people in Europe\
          \ by 2020</li> \n   <li>give <a href=\"https://www.globalscot.com/\">GlobalScot</a>\
          \ clearer 'asks' and 'offers' of support from <a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\"\
          >Scottish Development International</a></li> \n   <li>ask leading Scottish\

          \ \n   <li>continue to do all we can to increase our exports with key countries\
