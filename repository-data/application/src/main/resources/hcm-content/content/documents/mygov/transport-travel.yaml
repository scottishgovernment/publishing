            <p>If you plan on travelling by ferry, you should check the timetable to find out the departure and arrival times.</p>
            <p>Many ferry timetables also include train times from major stations (like Glasgow Central), to help you plan getting to the harbour.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.calmac.co.uk">Visit the Caledonian MacBrayne (CalMac) website</a> for full timetables for all CalMac services.</p>
            <p>This site also lists timetables from all other ferry operators, in case the ferry you want to take isn&#39;t operated by CalMac.</p>

              \ \n  <p>The ramps on all buses must be in full working order at all\

              \  <p>Some buses have 'next stop' indicators which tell you what the\
              \ next stop is on a screen and with a voice announcement. If a bus doesn't\
              \ have this, you can use the Scot Talk app, or ask the driver to tell\
              \ you when you have reached your stop.</p> \n  <p>If you want to get\
              \ off at the next stop, the stop request button lets you tell the driver.\
              \ They're usually on grab rails and at chest height.</p> \n  <p>Assistance\
              \ dogs are allowed on all buses and there's no limit to on how many\

              \ <p>They may be able to make sure a wheelchair space is available,\
              \ or make sure staff help with putting luggage on the coach.</p> \n\
              \  <p>You should contact the operator at least 36 hours before you travel\
              \ so they can understand what you need, and tell you what assistance\
              \ they can give you at each stage of your journey. You can find contact\

              \ runs out in 4-6 weeks and you haven't heard from your local council\
              \ or Transport Scotland about renewing it, contact <a href=\"https://www.transport.gov.scot/concessionary-travel/\"\
              >Transport Scotland</a> and let them know your card is expiring soon.</p>\
              \ \n  <h2 id=\"companion-cards\">Companion cards</h2> \n  <p>You can\
              \ get a companion card for a companion to travel with you, if you meet\
              \ certain eligibility criteria. <a href=\"https://www.transport.gov.scot/concessionary-travel/\"\
              >Transport Scotland</a> has details of the eligibility criteria and\
              \ the application process.</p> \n  <h2 id=\"travelling-on-buses\">Travelling\
              \ on buses</h2> \n  <p>All of Scotland's buses are wheelchair accessible.\
              \ This means they're designed to provide easy access and space for wheelchair\
              \ users and buggies. </p> \n  <p>If a wheelchair user wants to board\
              \ the bus, buggy users might be asked to move or fold their buggy up.</p>\
              \ \n  <p>The ramps on all buses must be in full working order at all\
              \ times. The law says every bus driver and conductor must provide reasonable\
              \ assistance to disabled people to board and get off the bus.</p> \n\
              \  <p>Some buses have 'next stop' indicators which tell you what the\
              \ next stop is on a screen and with a voice announcement. If a bus doesn't\
              \ have this, you can use the Scot Talk app, or ask the driver to tell\
              \ you when you have reached your stop.</p> \n  <p>If you want to get\
              \ off at the next stop, the stop request button lets you tell the driver.\
              \ They're usually on grab rails and at chest height.</p> \n  <p>Assistance\
              \ dogs are allowed on all buses and there's no limit to on how many\
              \ are allowed on at any time, as long as it's safe.</p> \n  <h2 id=\"\
              coaches\">Coaches</h2> \n  <p>There are two long-distance coach operators\
              \ operating in Scotland who offer assistance to passengers.</p> \n \
              \ <p>They may be able to make sure a wheelchair space is available,\
              \ or make sure staff help with putting luggage on the coach.</p> \n\
              \  <p>You should contact the operator at least 36 hours before you travel\
              \ so they can understand what you need, and tell you what assistance\
              \ they can give you at each stage of your journey. You can find contact\
              \ details on their websites:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"http://www.citylink.co.uk/assistedtravel.php\"\
              >Scottish Citylink</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"http://www.nationalexpress.com/help-and-advice/about-us/disabled-travellers.aspx#3\"\
              >National Express</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you're able to, book\
              \ your coach travel in advance. This will give the transport provider\
              \ more time to meet your needs.</p> \n  <h2 id=\"trams\">Trams</h2>\
              \ \n  <p>If you hold a Scottish National Entitlement Card, issued by\
              \ the City of Edinburgh Council, you can travel for free on Edinburgh\
              \ trams. Scottish National Entitlement Cards that were not issued by\
              \ Edinburgh Council are not valid on tram services, unless you are blind\

              \ to find out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-medical-conditions\"\
              >what you need to do if you're driving and have a medical condition\
              \ or disability</a>.</p> \n  <h2 id=\"help-with-parking\">Help with\
              \ parking</h2> \n  <p>The <a href=\"index\">Blue Badge scheme</a> provides\
              \ parking concessions for disabled people travelling either as drivers\
              \ or passengers.</p> \n  <p>This means you can park closer to where\
              \ you need to go. You'll be exempt from certain parking restrictions,\
              \ like being allowed to park:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>free at on-street\
              \ parking meters and in Pay and Display bays</li> \n   <li>up to three\
              \ hours on single and double yellow lines</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2 id=\"\
              getting-changes-to-the-roads\">Getting changes to the roads</h2> \n\
              \  <p>You can get changes to the roads in your local area to make it\
              \ more accessible:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p>You can report access problems\
              \ to your council. This can include the pavement not being easily accessible,\
              \ broken street lights or roadworks not being properly safeguarded.</p>\
              \ </li> \n   <li><p>You may be able to get part of the kerb and footway\
              \ in your street lowered for easier access, but you must talk to your\
              \ council first.</p> </li> \n   <li><p>If you have a Blue Badge, you\
              \ may be able to get a disabled person's parking space outside your\
              \ home. The space won't just be for you though – anyone with a Blue\
              \ Badge can park there.</p> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2 id=\"help-to-buy-a-car\"\

              >Motability Scheme</a> can help you with leasing or buying a car, powered\
              \ wheelchair or scooter – to be used by you or someone caring for you.\
              \ </p> \n  <p>You can get this if you're on the higher rate mobility\

              \ \n  <h2 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h2> \n  <p>Taxis and private hire cars\
              \ won't always be accessible. Some will be wheelchair accessible, while\
              \ others won't. You can contact a taxi company and ask to book a car\
              \ which is right for your needs.</p> \n  <p>To find a taxi service in\
              \ your area, contact your local council. They can provide a list of\
              \ licensed taxi and private hire car operators.</p> \n  <p>If a taxi\
              \ or private hire car is wheelchair accessible, the driver must be able\
              \ to carry your wheelchair, at no extra charge, unless they can't for\
              \ medical reasons. You can ask to see their medical exemption certificate.</p>\
              \ \n  <p>There's no extra charge for carrying an assistance dog. A driver\
              \ can only refuse to carry an assistance dog if they have a medical\
              \ exemption certificate – you can ask to see this. </p> \n  <h3 id=\"\

          publishing:authorNotes: "05/06/2020 - tribunal address updated requested\
            \ by Sharon Wood. SMc\n\n05/06/2020 - no response from SME. Set new review\
            \ date for 6 months. SMc\n\n#When to appeal\nYou have a right to challenge\
            \ a ['Penalty Charge Notice'](MYGOV-1494) (kind of parking ticket) or\
            \ Bus Lane Charge you think has been wrongly issued. \n\nThe [initial\
            \ challenge](/parking-tickets/challenge-a-parking-ticket/) should be sent\
            \ to the council that fined you. It must be sent within 28 days of when\
            \ the ticket was issued. \n\nIf the council rejects your challenge, you'll\
            \ be sent a 'Notice of Rejection'. You can [appeal this rejection](/parking-appeals/how-to-appeal/).\n\
            \n{{bq \"There's no fee for an appeal but the council or the person appealing\
            \ may have to pay expenses. This is when the appeal or the decision being\
            \ appealed against is 'wholly unreasonable'\" \"note\"}}\n\n##Legal grounds\
            \ for appeal\nThe following grounds for appeal are taken from [schedule\
            \ 6, section 2](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/40/schedule/6/enacted)\
            \ of the Road Traffic Act 1991.\n\nYou might want to appeal because:\n\
            - you didn't own the vehicle when it got the ticket\n- it didn't happen\
            \ e.g. your meter hadn't run out \n- the vehicle was stolen or taken without\
            \ your permission\n- the signs or road markings were not correct\n- the\
            \ penalty was more than it should have been\n- your car was towed away\
            \ incorrectly and you want a refund on the recovery fee  \n- you're a\
            \ car hire firm, the vehicle was hired out at the time and the driver\
            \ signed a 'liability agreement' for any penalty charge notice \n- the\
            \ council didn't follow the [Local Authorities' Traffic Orders (Procedure)\
            \ (Scotland) Regulations 1999](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/614/body/made)\
            \ \n\n> The way you appeal is different if you get a [parking](/parking-tickets/challenge-a-parking-ticket/),\
            \ bus lane or car towing Fixed Penalty Notice from the police.\n\n#How\
            \ to appeal \nFill in the 'Notice of Appeal' form that is sent with the\
            \ 'Notice of Rejection' from the council. Send it to the address below\
            \ within 28 days along with any evidence you want to submit. \n\nIf the\
            \ form arrives after 28 days you must give a reason why it's late. It\
            \ may not be accepted.\n\n**The Parking and Bus Lane Tribunal for Scotland**\
            \  \nThe Stamp Office  \n10 Waterloo Place  \nEdinburgh  \nEH1 3EG  \n\
            Phone: 0131 221 0409  \n\n> You can also use the contact details above\
            \ if you want to check the status of your appeal.\n\nThe tribunal will\
            \ let you know when your Notice of Appeal has been received. \n\n###If\
            \ someone else was driving \nThe appeal must be completed by the person\
            \ who received the 'Notice of Rejection' from the local council. This\
            \ is usually the owner.\n\nIf someone else was driving when the ticket\
            \ was issued, they can [appeal the ticket](/parking-tickets/challenge-a-parking-ticket/)\
            \ for the owner. They must have the owner's permission to appeal. \n\n\
            > The owner will be asked to pay the ticket if the appeal is rejected.\n\
            \n##Evidence \nIf you're providing evidence for your case you should send\
            \ it with your Notice of Appeal. \n\n###Evidence could be:\n- a pay and\
            \ display ticket \n- a disabled person's [Blue Badge](/apply-blue-badge/)\
            \ \n- photos that show signs or road markings\n- witness statements that\
            \ have the witness' name, address and signature\n- documents relating\
            \ to the sale of the vehicle \n- delivery documents for loading or unloading\n\
            - a garage bill for a breakdown\n\n###Don't send your:\n- 'Penalty Charge\
            \ Notice' or 'Bus Lane Charge Notice'\n- appeal to the local council \n\
            - 'Notice of Rejection'\n\nThe local council will send these as part of\
            \ its own evidence. You should keep your copies to bring if there's a\
            \ hearing.\n\n#How the decision is made \n\nOnce you've [submitted your\
            \ Notice of Appeal](/parking-appeals/how-to-appeal/), the council will\
            \ be told about your appeal. If the council:\n\n* accepts your appeal\
            \ - you don't need to pay the ticket and any organised hearings will be\
            \ cancelled \n* doesn't accept your appeal - an independent adjudicator\
            \ (a lawyer) will decide your case\n\nYou can choose to have a postal\
            \ decision or a personal hearing. \n\n> Adjucators can't consider whether\
            \ the incident happened for a 'good reason' or why it happened. They can\
            \ only consider the [legal grounds of appeal](/parking-appeals/when-to-appeal/)\
            \ and nothing else. \n\n##Postal decision \nIf you choose a postal decision,\
            \ you'll be told when the case will be given to the adjudicator to decide.\n\
            \nIf you wish to put in more evidence, it must be received well before\
            \ the date you're given.\n\nAfter that date, you'll get a written decision\
            \ sent to you or you'll be asked for further evidence.\n\n##Personal hearing\
            \ \nYou'll tell the adjudicator about your case in person if you choose\
            \ a personal hearing. \n\nPersonal hearings last around 30 minutes. Usually\
            \ they're held in the area where the incident took place. You can ask\
            \ the tribunal whether your hearing can take place closer to where you\
            \ live. \n\nIf you want someone to attend the hearing in your place you\
            \ must:\n* let the tribunal know in advance\n* give the person a written\
            \ letter that says you want them to attend for you and has your signature\
            \ on it\n\nYou'll be given 28 days' notice of the date and venue. \n\n\
            Contact the tribunal in advance to ask:\n\n- for a different date or venue\
            \ \n- for special access requirements \n- to switch to a postal hearing\
            \ \n\n> Someone from the council that gave you the ticket is allowed to\
            \ attend the hearing. You'll be told before the hearing if someone will\
            \ attend. \n\n#After the decision \nThe tribunal will send you a written\
            \ decision about your appeal.  \n\nIt will be:\n- appeal allowed \n- appeal\
            \ refused \n- or case delayed, known as an 'Adjournment Notice'\n\n###Appeal\
            \ allowed\nThis means you don't need to pay the ticket or your recovery\
            \ fee may be refunded in car towing cases.\n\n###Appeal refused \nYou'll\
            \ need to pay the ticket within 28 days of receiving the written decision.\n\
            \nIn car towing cases, this means your recovery fee won't be refunded.\n\
            \nIf you don't pay within 28 days, the council will:\n* give you a 'Charge\
            \ Certificate'\n* increase your penalty by 50% and you must pay it within\
            \ 14 days\n\n{{bq \"If you don't pay the Charge Certificate within 14\
            \ days, the council can take legal action to get the money.\" \"caution\"\
            }}\n\nYour ticket won't be 'paid' until the council receives the money.\
            \ If you're paying by post you'll have to think about how long it'll take\
            \ to arrive.\n\n###Case delayed, known as an Adjournment Notice\nThe decision\
            \ won't be made until the adjudicator has the extra information asked\
            \ for.\n\n##Can I take any further action?\nYou can't have a new appeal,\
            \ but you may be able to: \n- make a complaint to the [Scottish Public\
            \ Services Ombudsman (SPSO)](http://www.spso.org.uk/) about the council\n\
            - ask for a review of the adjudicators decision\n- ask for the decision\
            \ to be reviewed in a court case called a 'Judical Review'\n\n###Complain\
            \ to the SPSO\nIf you're not happy with the response you've had from the\
            \ council you can contact the SPSO. It's the final stage for complaints\
            \ about councils.\n\nYou can contact SPSO via:\n* its [website](http://www.spso.org.uk)\n\

            \ EH3 7NS \n* in writing: FREEPOST EH641, Edinburgh, EH3 0BR\n\n###Review\
            \ of adjucators decision\nFor example a review of the adjucators decision\
            \ can take place when:\n* the decision was wrongly made due to an administrative\
            \ error\n* you had 'good' reason for not attending your hearing or getting\
            \ someone else to attend for you, e.g you were taken into hospital on\
            \ the day\n* new evidence became available after the decision which you\
            \ couldn't have known about \n\n###Ask for the decision to be reviewed\
            \ in a Judicial Review\nYou need legal advice if you want the decision\
            \ to be reviewed in a 'Judicial Review'. \n\nA 'Judicial Review' is when\
            \ a judge considers whether a decision or action made by a public body\
            \ was lawful. They look at the way a decision has been made, rather than\
            \ the rights and wrongs of the judgement reached.\n\n##If you can't afford\
            \ to pay a parking ticket or bus lane fine\nIf you can't afford to pay\
            \ your parking or bus lane fine, [Citizens Advice Scotland](http://www.cas.org.uk/bureaux)\
            \ can give you advice on money, debt and the law."

            \ by Sharon Wood. SMc\n\n05/06/2020 - no response from SME. Set new review\
            \ date for 6 months. SMc\n\n#When to appeal\nYou have a right to challenge\
            \ a ['Penalty Charge Notice'](MYGOV-1494) (kind of parking ticket) or\
            \ Bus Lane Charge you think has been wrongly issued. \n\nThe [initial\
            \ challenge](/parking-tickets/challenge-a-parking-ticket/) should be sent\
            \ to the council that fined you. It must be sent within 28 days of when\
            \ the ticket was issued. \n\nIf the council rejects your challenge, you'll\
            \ be sent a 'Notice of Rejection'. You can [appeal this rejection](/parking-appeals/how-to-appeal/).\n\
            \n{{bq \"There's no fee for an appeal but the council or the person appealing\
            \ may have to pay expenses. This is when the appeal or the decision being\
            \ appealed against is 'wholly unreasonable'\" \"note\"}}\n\n##Legal grounds\
            \ for appeal\nThe following grounds for appeal are taken from [schedule\
            \ 6, section 2](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/40/schedule/6/enacted)\
            \ of the Road Traffic Act 1991.\n\nYou might want to appeal because:\n\
            - you didn't own the vehicle when it got the ticket\n- it didn't happen\
            \ e.g. your meter hadn't run out \n- the vehicle was stolen or taken without\
            \ your permission\n- the signs or road markings were not correct\n- the\
            \ penalty was more than it should have been\n- your car was towed away\
            \ incorrectly and you want a refund on the recovery fee  \n- you're a\
            \ car hire firm, the vehicle was hired out at the time and the driver\
            \ signed a 'liability agreement' for any penalty charge notice \n- the\
            \ council didn't follow the [Local Authorities' Traffic Orders (Procedure)\
            \ (Scotland) Regulations 1999](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/614/body/made)\
            \ \n\n> The way you appeal is different if you get a [parking](/parking-tickets/challenge-a-parking-ticket/),\
            \ bus lane or car towing Fixed Penalty Notice from the police.\n\n#How\
            \ to appeal \nFill in the 'Notice of Appeal' form that is sent with the\
            \ 'Notice of Rejection' from the council. Send it to the address below\
            \ within 28 days along with any evidence you want to submit. \n\nIf the\
            \ form arrives after 28 days you must give a reason why it's late. It\
            \ may not be accepted.\n\n**The Parking and Bus Lane Tribunal for Scotland**\
            \  \nThe Stamp Office  \n10 Waterloo Place  \nEdinburgh  \nEH1 3EG  \n\
            Phone: 0131 221 0409  \n\n> You can also use the contact details above\
            \ if you want to check the status of your appeal.\n\nThe tribunal will\
            \ let you know when your Notice of Appeal has been received. \n\n###If\
            \ someone else was driving \nThe appeal must be completed by the person\
            \ who received the 'Notice of Rejection' from the local council. This\
            \ is usually the owner.\n\nIf someone else was driving when the ticket\
            \ was issued, they can [appeal the ticket](/parking-tickets/challenge-a-parking-ticket/)\
            \ for the owner. They must have the owner's permission to appeal. \n\n\
            > The owner will be asked to pay the ticket if the appeal is rejected.\n\
            \n##Evidence \nIf you're providing evidence for your case you should send\
            \ it with your Notice of Appeal. \n\n###Evidence could be:\n- a pay and\
            \ display ticket \n- a disabled person's [Blue Badge](/apply-blue-badge/)\

            \ Notice of Appeal](/parking-appeals/how-to-appeal/), the council will\
            \ be told about your appeal. If the council:\n\n* accepts your appeal\

          publishing:authorNotes: "05/06/2020 - tribunal address updated requested\
            \ by Sharon Wood. SMc\n\n05/06/2020 - no response from SME. Set new review\
            \ date for 6 months. SMc\n\n#When to appeal\nYou have a right to challenge\
            \ a ['Penalty Charge Notice'](MYGOV-1494) (kind of parking ticket) or\
            \ Bus Lane Charge you think has been wrongly issued. \n\nThe [initial\
            \ challenge](/parking-tickets/challenge-a-parking-ticket/) should be sent\
            \ to the council that fined you. It must be sent within 28 days of when\
            \ the ticket was issued. \n\nIf the council rejects your challenge, you'll\
            \ be sent a 'Notice of Rejection'. You can [appeal this rejection](/parking-appeals/how-to-appeal/).\n\
            \n{{bq \"There's no fee for an appeal but the council or the person appealing\
            \ may have to pay expenses. This is when the appeal or the decision being\
            \ appealed against is 'wholly unreasonable'\" \"note\"}}\n\n##Legal grounds\
            \ for appeal\nThe following grounds for appeal are taken from [schedule\
            \ 6, section 2](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/40/schedule/6/enacted)\
            \ of the Road Traffic Act 1991.\n\nYou might want to appeal because:\n\
            - you didn't own the vehicle when it got the ticket\n- it didn't happen\
            \ e.g. your meter hadn't run out \n- the vehicle was stolen or taken without\
            \ your permission\n- the signs or road markings were not correct\n- the\
            \ penalty was more than it should have been\n- your car was towed away\
            \ incorrectly and you want a refund on the recovery fee  \n- you're a\
            \ car hire firm, the vehicle was hired out at the time and the driver\
            \ signed a 'liability agreement' for any penalty charge notice \n- the\
            \ council didn't follow the [Local Authorities' Traffic Orders (Procedure)\
            \ (Scotland) Regulations 1999](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/614/body/made)\
            \ \n\n> The way you appeal is different if you get a [parking](/parking-tickets/challenge-a-parking-ticket/),\
            \ bus lane or car towing Fixed Penalty Notice from the police.\n\n#How\
            \ to appeal \nFill in the 'Notice of Appeal' form that is sent with the\
            \ 'Notice of Rejection' from the council. Send it to the address below\
            \ within 28 days along with any evidence you want to submit. \n\nIf the\
            \ form arrives after 28 days you must give a reason why it's late. It\
            \ may not be accepted.\n\n**The Parking and Bus Lane Tribunal for Scotland**\
            \  \nThe Stamp Office  \n10 Waterloo Place  \nEdinburgh  \nEH1 3EG  \n\
            Phone: 0131 221 0409  \n\n> You can also use the contact details above\
            \ if you want to check the status of your appeal.\n\nThe tribunal will\
            \ let you know when your Notice of Appeal has been received. \n\n###If\
            \ someone else was driving \nThe appeal must be completed by the person\
            \ who received the 'Notice of Rejection' from the local council. This\
            \ is usually the owner.\n\nIf someone else was driving when the ticket\
            \ was issued, they can [appeal the ticket](/parking-tickets/challenge-a-parking-ticket/)\
            \ for the owner. They must have the owner's permission to appeal. \n\n\
            > The owner will be asked to pay the ticket if the appeal is rejected.\n\
            \n##Evidence \nIf you're providing evidence for your case you should send\
            \ it with your Notice of Appeal. \n\n###Evidence could be:\n- a pay and\
            \ display ticket \n- a disabled person's [Blue Badge](/apply-blue-badge/)\
            \ \n- photos that show signs or road markings\n- witness statements that\
            \ have the witness' name, address and signature\n- documents relating\
            \ to the sale of the vehicle \n- delivery documents for loading or unloading\n\
            - a garage bill for a breakdown\n\n###Don't send your:\n- 'Penalty Charge\
            \ Notice' or 'Bus Lane Charge Notice'\n- appeal to the local council \n\
            - 'Notice of Rejection'\n\nThe local council will send these as part of\
            \ its own evidence. You should keep your copies to bring if there's a\
            \ hearing.\n\n#How the decision is made \n\nOnce you've [submitted your\
            \ Notice of Appeal](/parking-appeals/how-to-appeal/), the council will\
            \ be told about your appeal. If the council:\n\n* accepts your appeal\
            \ - you don't need to pay the ticket and any organised hearings will be\
            \ cancelled \n* doesn't accept your appeal - an independent adjudicator\
            \ (a lawyer) will decide your case\n\nYou can choose to have a postal\
            \ decision or a personal hearing. \n\n> Adjucators can't consider whether\
            \ the incident happened for a 'good reason' or why it happened. They can\
            \ only consider the [legal grounds of appeal](/parking-appeals/when-to-appeal/)\
            \ and nothing else. \n\n##Postal decision \nIf you choose a postal decision,\
            \ you'll be told when the case will be given to the adjudicator to decide.\n\
            \nIf you wish to put in more evidence, it must be received well before\
            \ the date you're given.\n\nAfter that date, you'll get a written decision\
            \ sent to you or you'll be asked for further evidence.\n\n##Personal hearing\
            \ \nYou'll tell the adjudicator about your case in person if you choose\
            \ a personal hearing. \n\nPersonal hearings last around 30 minutes. Usually\
            \ they're held in the area where the incident took place. You can ask\
            \ the tribunal whether your hearing can take place closer to where you\
            \ live. \n\nIf you want someone to attend the hearing in your place you\
            \ must:\n* let the tribunal know in advance\n* give the person a written\
            \ letter that says you want them to attend for you and has your signature\
            \ on it\n\nYou'll be given 28 days' notice of the date and venue. \n\n\
            Contact the tribunal in advance to ask:\n\n- for a different date or venue\
            \ \n- for special access requirements \n- to switch to a postal hearing\
            \ \n\n> Someone from the council that gave you the ticket is allowed to\
            \ attend the hearing. You'll be told before the hearing if someone will\
            \ attend. \n\n#After the decision \nThe tribunal will send you a written\
            \ decision about your appeal.  \n\nIt will be:\n- appeal allowed \n- appeal\
            \ refused \n- or case delayed, known as an 'Adjournment Notice'\n\n###Appeal\
            \ allowed\nThis means you don't need to pay the ticket or your recovery\
            \ fee may be refunded in car towing cases.\n\n###Appeal refused \nYou'll\
            \ need to pay the ticket within 28 days of receiving the written decision.\n\
            \nIn car towing cases, this means your recovery fee won't be refunded.\n\
            \nIf you don't pay within 28 days, the council will:\n* give you a 'Charge\
            \ Certificate'\n* increase your penalty by 50% and you must pay it within\
            \ 14 days\n\n{{bq \"If you don't pay the Charge Certificate within 14\
            \ days, the council can take legal action to get the money.\" \"caution\"\
            }}\n\nYour ticket won't be 'paid' until the council receives the money.\
            \ If you're paying by post you'll have to think about how long it'll take\
            \ to arrive.\n\n###Case delayed, known as an Adjournment Notice\nThe decision\
            \ won't be made until the adjudicator has the extra information asked\
            \ for.\n\n##Can I take any further action?\nYou can't have a new appeal,\
            \ but you may be able to: \n- make a complaint to the [Scottish Public\
            \ Services Ombudsman (SPSO)](http://www.spso.org.uk/) about the council\n\
            - ask for a review of the adjudicators decision\n- ask for the decision\
            \ to be reviewed in a court case called a 'Judical Review'\n\n###Complain\
            \ to the SPSO\nIf you're not happy with the response you've had from the\
            \ council you can contact the SPSO. It's the final stage for complaints\
            \ about councils.\n\nYou can contact SPSO via:\n* its [website](http://www.spso.org.uk)\n\
            * telephone: 0800 377 7330 \n* in person: 4 Melville Street, Edinburgh,\
            \ EH3 7NS \n* in writing: FREEPOST EH641, Edinburgh, EH3 0BR\n\n###Review\
            \ of adjucators decision\nFor example a review of the adjucators decision\
            \ can take place when:\n* the decision was wrongly made due to an administrative\
            \ error\n* you had 'good' reason for not attending your hearing or getting\
            \ someone else to attend for you, e.g you were taken into hospital on\
            \ the day\n* new evidence became available after the decision which you\
            \ couldn't have known about \n\n###Ask for the decision to be reviewed\
            \ in a Judicial Review\nYou need legal advice if you want the decision\
            \ to be reviewed in a 'Judicial Review'. \n\nA 'Judicial Review' is when\
            \ a judge considers whether a decision or action made by a public body\
            \ was lawful. They look at the way a decision has been made, rather than\
            \ the rights and wrongs of the judgement reached.\n\n##If you can't afford\
            \ to pay a parking ticket or bus lane fine\nIf you can't afford to pay\
            \ your parking or bus lane fine, [Citizens Advice Scotland](http://www.cas.org.uk/bureaux)\
            \ can give you advice on money, debt and the law."

            <h2 id="scotland-s-drink-drive-limits">Scotland&#39;s drink drive limits</h2>
            <p>There are strict alcohol limits for drivers, but it&#39;s impossible to say exactly how many drinks this equals – it&#39;s different for each person. Any alcohol in your body can adversely affect how you drive.   </p>
            <p>The current limits are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>22 mcg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath (the &#39;breath limit&#39;)</li>
            <li>50 mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood (the &#39;blood limit&#39;)</li>
            <li>67 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of urine (the &#39;urine limit&#39;)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means that just one drink could put you over the legal limit for driving. </p>

            <li>use public transport (but take taxi numbers in case you miss the last bus or train)</li>
            <li>if you have to drive, stick to zero alcohol beers, mocktails or soft drinks</li>

            <p>However, even a small amount can affect the speed of your reactions and compromise your ability to drive. The safest thing to do is find <a href="http://dontriskit.info/drink-driving/plan-ahead/">an alternative way to get home.</a></p>

            <p>There are strict alcohol limits for drivers, but it&#39;s impossible to say exactly how many drinks this equals – it&#39;s different for each person. Any alcohol in your body can adversely affect how you drive.   </p>
            <p>The current limits are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>22 mcg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath (the &#39;breath limit&#39;)</li>
            <li>50 mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood (the &#39;blood limit&#39;)</li>
            <li>67 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of urine (the &#39;urine limit&#39;)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means that just one drink could put you over the legal limit for driving. </p>

            <ul>
            <li>if you&#39;re going out with a group of friends, agree who will be the one who does not drink so they can drive everyone home safely</li>
            <li>use public transport (but take taxi numbers in case you miss the last bus or train)</li>
            <li>if you have to drive, stick to zero alcohol beers, mocktails or soft drinks</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="getting-home-safely">Getting home safely</h2>
            <p>If you decide to go for a drink when you have your car it&#39;s easy to be tempted to drive home afterwards, especially if you&#39;ve only had a small amount.</p>
            <p>However, even a small amount can affect the speed of your reactions and compromise your ability to drive. The safest thing to do is find <a href="http://dontriskit.info/drink-driving/plan-ahead/">an alternative way to get home.</a></p>

            <p>If you&#39;ve been bereaved or injured in a road crash and it wasn&#39;t your fault, you can claim compensation.</p>
            <p>This is money paid to help ease any physical or mental trauma you suffered because of the road crash.</p>
            <p>Some people find it difficult to think about compensation at this time. You can claim compensation up to 3 years after the date of the road crash. If a child under 16 was involved, you can claim compensation for them at any point until they turn 19.</p>
            <h2 id="if-you-were-bereaved-by-a-road-crash">If you were bereaved by a road crash</h2>
            <p>If you have lost someone close to you because of a road crash:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>any compensation payment will be through the driver&#39;s insurance company or the <a href="https://www.mib.org.uk/">Motor Insurers&#39; Bureau</a> if the driver was uninsured </li>
            <li>the amount that can be claimed depends on your relationship with the person who died, and other factors that a personal injury solicitor can advise you on </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="if-you-were-seriously-injured-by-a-road-crash">If you were seriously injured by a road crash</h2>
            <p>If you have been injured because of a road crash, a claim for compensation depends on:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>how severe your injuries were </li>
            <li>any emotional trauma suffered </li>
            <li>any physical or financial loss suffered </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The amount which can be claimed depends on a number of factors, which a personal injury solicitor can advise you on. </p>
            <h2 id="if-you-have-been-injured-following-a-minor-road-crash">If you have been injured following a minor road crash</h2>
            <p>Before you look into claiming for compensation, there are a number of steps you should take. These include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>calling your insurance company to let them know the road crash happened </li>
            <li>telling the police</li>
            <li>reporting the injury to your doctor – it may be more serious than it feels, and if the case goes to court they may be asked to provide a medical report </li>
            <li>gathering any evidence you can and writing a detailed description of what happened, including any witnesses, while it&#39;s fresh in your mind </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="making-a-claim">Making a claim</h2>
            <p>There are a number of ways to claim compensation following a road crash. For most you will need to contact either a solicitor or claims assessor. You shouldn&#39;t have to pay a solicitor to meet with them to discuss your case. </p>
            <h3 id="solicitor">Solicitor</h3>
            <p>If you <a href="/find-solicitor/">contact a specialist solicitor</a> they will hear the details of your story and, based on what evidence is available, will advise how much compensation you should claim for.</p>
            <p>A solicitor can also give you information on the next steps to take, and can take the case to court for you.</p>
            <p>You will have to pay for legal action for compensation, though you might be able to <a href="/legal-aid/">apply for legal aid</a> to help you cover the cost.</p>
            <h3 id="claims-assessor">Claims assessor</h3>
            <p>A claims assessor will offer to take on your case on a &#39;no win, no fee&#39; basis. This means if your compensation claim isn&#39;t successful, you won&#39;t have to pay anything (such as solicitor&#39;s fees).</p>
            <p>However, claims assessors aren&#39;t usually solicitors, so they won&#39;t be able to take your case to court. This means you may get less compensation.</p>
            <p>They may also ask you to pay a percentage of your compensation to them. If you&#39;re claiming for a large amount of money, the percentage you pay to the assessor may work out more expensive than a solicitor would have cost.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;ve been bereaved or injured in a road crash and it wasn&#39;t your fault, you can claim compensation.</p>
            <p>This is money paid to help ease any physical or mental trauma you suffered because of the road crash.</p>
            <p>Some people find it difficult to think about compensation at this time. You can claim compensation up to 3 years after the date of the road crash. If a child under 16 was involved, you can claim compensation for them at any point until they turn 19.</p>
            <h2 id="if-you-were-bereaved-by-a-road-crash">If you were bereaved by a road crash</h2>
            <p>If you have lost someone close to you because of a road crash:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>any compensation payment will be through the driver&#39;s insurance company or the <a href="https://www.mib.org.uk/">Motor Insurers&#39; Bureau</a> if the driver was uninsured </li>
            <li>the amount that can be claimed depends on your relationship with the person who died, and other factors that a personal injury solicitor can advise you on </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="if-you-were-seriously-injured-by-a-road-crash">If you were seriously injured by a road crash</h2>
            <p>If you have been injured because of a road crash, a claim for compensation depends on:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>how severe your injuries were </li>
            <li>any emotional trauma suffered </li>
            <li>any physical or financial loss suffered </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The amount which can be claimed depends on a number of factors, which a personal injury solicitor can advise you on. </p>
            <h2 id="if-you-have-been-injured-following-a-minor-road-crash">If you have been injured following a minor road crash</h2>
            <p>Before you look into claiming for compensation, there are a number of steps you should take. These include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>calling your insurance company to let them know the road crash happened </li>
            <li>telling the police</li>
            <li>reporting the injury to your doctor – it may be more serious than it feels, and if the case goes to court they may be asked to provide a medical report </li>
            <li>gathering any evidence you can and writing a detailed description of what happened, including any witnesses, while it&#39;s fresh in your mind </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="making-a-claim">Making a claim</h2>
            <p>There are a number of ways to claim compensation following a road crash. For most you will need to contact either a solicitor or claims assessor. You shouldn&#39;t have to pay a solicitor to meet with them to discuss your case. </p>
            <h3 id="solicitor">Solicitor</h3>
            <p>If you <a href="/find-solicitor/">contact a specialist solicitor</a> they will hear the details of your story and, based on what evidence is available, will advise how much compensation you should claim for.</p>
            <p>A solicitor can also give you information on the next steps to take, and can take the case to court for you.</p>
            <p>You will have to pay for legal action for compensation, though you might be able to <a href="/legal-aid/">apply for legal aid</a> to help you cover the cost.</p>
            <h3 id="claims-assessor">Claims assessor</h3>
            <p>A claims assessor will offer to take on your case on a &#39;no win, no fee&#39; basis. This means if your compensation claim isn&#39;t successful, you won&#39;t have to pay anything (such as solicitor&#39;s fees).</p>
            <p>However, claims assessors aren&#39;t usually solicitors, so they won&#39;t be able to take your case to court. This means you may get less compensation.</p>
            <p>They may also ask you to pay a percentage of your compensation to them. If you&#39;re claiming for a large amount of money, the percentage you pay to the assessor may work out more expensive than a solicitor would have cost.</p>
