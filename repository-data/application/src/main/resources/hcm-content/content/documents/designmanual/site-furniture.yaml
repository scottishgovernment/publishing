            <h2>What type of information we collect</h2>
            <p>We collect and process the following information when you visit designmanual.service.gov.scot:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>your IP address</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also use Google Analytics to collect information about:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>which type of browser and device you used</li>
              <li>the pages you visit on designmanual.service.gov.scot</li>
              <li>how long you spend on each designmanual.service.gov.scot page</li>
              <li>how you got to the site</li>
              <li>what you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Google Analytics data is only collected from users who have consented to share this data. Any information
            we get about you from Google Analytics will be anonymised before we see it. This means we will not hold any
            personally identifiable information about you, such as your name or address.</p>
            <h2>Why we collect this information</h2>
            <p>We use the information you share with us:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>to improve our services</li>
              <li>give you access to government services</li>
              <li>to identify security threats</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our legal basis for processing this data is ‘legitimate interests’. That’s because:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>it’s in the legitimate interests of our users to make improvements to our website</li>
              <li>we need to maintain the security of designmanual.service..gov.scot</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We only collect information about you using Google Analytics if you consent to it.</p>

            <h2>What we do with this information</h2>
            <p>We may share your anonymised information with other agencies or public bodies in the Scottish Government.
            But this will not include personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p>We’ll only share your data with a third party if we’re required to do so by law. For example by court
            order or to prevent fraud.</p>
            <p>We will not:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>sell or give your data to third parties</li>
              <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How long we keep your information</h2>
            <p>We will delete any feedback you share with us after 3 years. We keep anonymised analytics for 38 months.</p>

            data may be processed outside the EEA.</p>
            <p>We’re committed to doing everything we can to keep your data safe. We perform regular security tests to
            make sure our systems and processes are secure.</p>
