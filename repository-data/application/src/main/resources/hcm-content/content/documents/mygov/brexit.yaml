          <p>The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as &#39;Brexit&#39;. </p>
          <p>We&#39;re now in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">transition period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that&#39;s likely to last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still following EU rules. </p>
          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. </p>
          <p>This may include changes to civil rights.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The UK is now in the Brexit transition period. This means many of the details about what Brexit will mean are not yet known. This page gives the latest facts, but it will be updated as more details are confirmed. Please keep checking back for new information. </p>

          <p>Civil rights is a subject devolved to Scotland. These rights are protected under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents">Human Rights Act 1998</a> and in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/contents">Scotland Act 1998.</a> </p>

          <p>Your consumer rights will not change during the transition period, which is likely to last until December 2020.</p>
          <p>If there is a &#39;no deal&#39; situation, your consumer rights could change if you&#39;re buying products or services from an EU seller. Check the product&#39;s terms and conditions if you&#39;re not sure.</p>

          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. </p>

          <p>Scotland has measures in place to protect the environment, and these measures are supported by EU laws and standards. These EU laws and standards may be affected by Brexit.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is committed to making sure it meets EU environmental standards after Brexit.</p>
          <p>Environmental legislation is being corrected to make sure the law keeps working as it has been in key areas. The Scottish Government is working on this with public bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Natural Heritage.</p>

          <p>EU law is shaped by environmental principles – for example, that pollution should be prevented and dealt with at the source where it takes place, and that the polluter should pay for the cost of this.</p>

          <ul>
          <li>parental responsibilities and rights</li>
          <li>contact</li>
          <li>residence</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After Brexit, these EU rules will be replaced by other international rules, which Scotland currently follows in cases involving non-EU countries. These rules are similar to the EU rules.</p>
          <h3 id="family-maintenance">Family maintenance</h3>
          <p>The rules for family maintenance that are currently applied within the EU will be replaced by other existing international rules.</p>
          <p>This means maintenance can still be obtained and enforced between Scotland and EU countries. </p>
          <p>If you have a child maintenance decision you want to have recognised and enforced in an EU country, as well as speaking to your solicitor you can contact:</p>

          <p>After Brexit, the rules about abduction or wrongfully retained children in EU countries will mostly stay the same.</p>
          <p>If you&#39;re the applicant in a case to return a child who has been abducted to an EU country by a parent or a relative, you should contact:</p>

          <p>If there&#39;s a civil or commercial dispute where both parties are based in the UK, nothing will change after Brexit.</p>
          <p>If a dispute involves EU countries, however, some of the rules may change after Brexit.</p>
          <p>If we have not agreed an EU trade deal by the end of the transition period (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), some EU civil law agreements will no longer apply to the UK.</p>
          <p>This will affect rules on:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the country civil and commercial law disputes are heard in</li>
          <li>how decisions made in one country will be recognised and enforced in another</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are currently in a case you think may be affected by this (or you will be soon) you should speak to a lawyer. </p>
          <p>There will be no changes to the process until the end of the transition period (1 January 2021).</p>

          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. This may include changes to the fishing industry.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>Your current regulatory obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy and marine environment legislation remain in full effect throughout 2020. There are no changes to your operational reporting requirements or obligations. </p>
          <p>If you have any queries about your ongoing obligations, please contact your local fisheries office in the first instance. </p>
          <p>The aim is to conclude an EU-UK Fisheries Agreement by 1 July 2020 and a Free Trade Agreement with the EU by the end of December 2020. Marine Scotland will continue to monitor the progress of the negotiations and how this will impact your business in January 2020. If you have any queries, please <a href="mailto:MARINE.BREXIT@GOV.SCOT">email the Marine Scotland EU hub</a>. </p>
          <p>The EU has different fishing requirements for &#39;third countries&#39; (countries not in the EU). If the transition period ends before an EU trade deal has been agreed (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), Scottish fisheries will have to follow these requirements. </p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.scot/collections/marine-and-fisheries-exiting-the-eu/">The Scottish Government has created guidance</a> that explains the new requirements you will have to follow if you:</p>

          <li>export non-UK &#39;third country&#39; fish to the EU</li>

          <h2 id="food-supplies">Food supplies</h2>
          <p>While much of the food and drink we have in Scotland is produced within Scotland and the UK, some of it gets imported into the UK from other countries in the EU and beyond.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with retailers, the food industry and others across the supply chain to make sure any disruption to the supply of food and drink will be kept to a minimum.</p>
          <h3 id="if-you-re-struggling-to-afford-food">If you&#39;re struggling to afford food</h3>
          <p>Some families in Scotland struggle to be able to afford or access food. This is also known as &#39;household food insecurity&#39;.</p>
          <p>Brexit may lead to some foods becoming more expensive or harder to find, which may affect those who need the most help.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government continues to look at ways to tackle and respond to food insecurity. This includes increasing the Fair Food Fund to £3.5 million in 2019-20 and investing an extra £1 million in <a href="https://fareshare.org.uk/">food redistribution.</a></p>
          <p>If you&#39;re worried about not being able to afford food, there are a number of ways you can get help. For example, you may be eligible for a <a href="/scottish-welfare-fund/">Scottish Welfare Fund Crisis Grant</a>.</p>
          <p>Citizens Advice Scotland gives <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/foodbanks-and-other-help-in-your-area/">information on support in your area.</a></p>
          <h3 id="exporting-for-food-businesses">Exporting for food businesses</h3>
          <p>If no EU trade deal has been agreed by the end of the Brexit transition period, there are likely to be effects on Scottish food and drink producers who export their goods to EU countries.</p>
          <p>Some of these goods (like beef and lamb) could face large tariffs.</p>
          <p>Others, like seafood, may have other barriers, like additional certification and delays in getting products to market. This could have a financial impact.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is working with the industry and others within the supply chain to assess the effects of this disruption and reduce any impacts.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.prepareforbrexit.scot/">The Prepare for Brexit site</a> is designed to help Scottish businesses prepare for Brexit by explaining what they may need to do to be able to continue exporting to the EU.</p>
          <h2 id="food-safety-and-standards">Food safety and standards</h2>
          <p>Food Standards Scotland is continuing to prepare for Brexit, to make sure that public health is still protected after the Brexit transition period ends.</p>
          <p>Most food law in Scotland currently comes from the EU and makes sure food that comes into the country is safe to eat and drink.</p>
          <p>Food Standards Scotland is working with the Scottish Government and UK Government to make sure the same protections will continue after Brexit.</p>
          <p>It&#39;s also working to make sure the public in Scotland are protected from any possible disruption to the supply chain.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/about-us/brexit">Food Standards Scotland website</a> gives more information on what it&#39;s been doing to prepare for Brexit.</p>

          <p>Others, like seafood, may have other barriers, like additional certification and delays in getting products to market. This could have a financial impact.</p>

          <p>Scotland&#39;s justice system and agencies play an important role in:</p>

          <li>investigating crime</li>
          <li>prosecuting crime</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Brexit may have an impact on some parts of the justice system, but the Scottish Government and justice agencies will continue to work to make sure Scotland is safe.</p>
          <p>Scotland has its own legal and judicial system, criminal laws and law enforcement agencies. The Scottish Government handles justice policy, while the Lord Advocate is head of the independent system that investigates and prosecutes crime.</p>
          <p>This justice system helps keep Scotland safe and fair, and it will continue to do this after Brexit.</p>
          <p>Scotland&#39;s prosecution and police services have a strong relationship with justice agencies in countries throughout the EU. Common tools like the European Arrest Warrant and other EU information-sharing measures help law agencies in Scotland and across the EU tackle cross-border crime and terrorism.</p>
          <p>The impact of Brexit may have an effect on how Scotland delivers justice and protects the public. However, the Scottish Government will aim, as far as it is able, to make sure Brexit doesn&#39;t affect Scotland&#39;s cross-border relationship with the EU, so our police and law enforcement agencies can continue fighting cross-border crime.</p>

          <ul>
          <li>protecting individual rights</li>
          <li>investigating crime</li>
          <li>prosecuting crime</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Brexit may have an impact on some parts of the justice system, but the Scottish Government and justice agencies will continue to work to make sure Scotland is safe.</p>
          <p>Scotland has its own legal and judicial system, criminal laws and law enforcement agencies. The Scottish Government handles justice policy, while the Lord Advocate is head of the independent system that investigates and prosecutes crime.</p>
          <p>This justice system helps keep Scotland safe and fair, and it will continue to do this after Brexit.</p>
          <p>Scotland&#39;s prosecution and police services have a strong relationship with justice agencies in countries throughout the EU. Common tools like the European Arrest Warrant and other EU information-sharing measures help law agencies in Scotland and across the EU tackle cross-border crime and terrorism.</p>
          <p>The impact of Brexit may have an effect on how Scotland delivers justice and protects the public. However, the Scottish Government will aim, as far as it is able, to make sure Brexit doesn&#39;t affect Scotland&#39;s cross-border relationship with the EU, so our police and law enforcement agencies can continue fighting cross-border crime.</p>
          <h2 id="hate-crime">Hate crime</h2>
          <p>Everybody should feel welcome in Scotland, no matter what their colour, race or background is.</p>

          <p>The taxes managed and collected by local authorities are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>council tax</li>

          <p>The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as &#39;Brexit&#39;. </p>
          <p>We&#39;re now in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">transition period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that&#39;s likely to last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still following EU rules.</p>
          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. </p>
          <p>This may include changes to travel to and from EU countries.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The UK is now in the Brexit transition period. This means many of the details about what Brexit will mean are not yet known. This page gives the latest facts, but it will be updated as more details are confirmed. Please keep checking back for new information. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> If the transition period ends before an EU trade deal has been agreed (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), you may need different documents to visit and drive in:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the EU</li>
          <li>Norway</li>
          <li>Liechtenstein</li>
          <li>Switzerland </li>
          <li>Iceland</li>
          <li>Andorra</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This includes travel to these countries by air, sea, coach, rail or Eurotunnel shuttle. Your legal rights as a passenger will stay the same.</p>
          <p>You may also need to make different arrangements in advance if you plan to travel with a pet. </p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-europe-1-january-2021">GOV.UK has guidance</a> on this.</p>
          <h2 id="passports">Passports</h2>
          <p> If the transition period ends before an EU trade deal has been agreed (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), the rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change for UK passport holders.</p>
          <p>If you travel to an EU country after Brexit, you should have at least 6 months left on your passport from the date you arrive. Your passport should also be less than 10 years old.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/passport-rules-for-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> which gives more information on which countries this affects.</p>
          <p>The existing Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland will continue. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance">GOV.UK has more information on this.</a></p>
          <h2 id="holidays-and-travel">Holidays and travel</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to travel by air, sea, coach, rail or Eurotunnel shuttle after Brexit, all these services are expected to run as normal after Brexit. However, you should check with your travel company for the latest information before you leave.</p>
          <p>If any of these services are delayed or cancelled, your consumer rights will remain the same.</p>
          <p>The European Commission has said that there will be no difference to travel and holidaymakers won&#39;t need a visa during the &#39;transition period&#39; (where the UK has left the EU but still follows EU rules while the new arrangements are made).</p>
          <p>You may still need to check your passport is valid for at least six months after the date you plan to travel. If you&#39;re travelling with a pet, or planning to drive in mainland Europe, you may need to make extra arrangements as explained on this page. There are still more details to be agreed – this site will be updated when there&#39;s more information.</p>

          <h3 id="travel-insurance">Travel insurance</h3>
          <p>If you have a European Health Insurance Card, it may not be valid after Brexit. You must make sure that you have suitable insurance and healthcare cover, especially if you have a pre-existing condition.</p>
          <h2 id="driving-in-the-eu">Driving in the EU</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to drive in the EU after Brexit and have a UK Driving Licence, you may need to apply for and carry an International Driving Permit.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> on this.</p>
          <p>You may also need to apply for and carry a Green Card to prove you have third party insurance if you&#39;re driving in:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the EU</li>
          <li>EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway)</li>
          <li>Andorra, Serbia or Switzerland</li>

          <h2 id="travelling-with-pets">Travelling with pets</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to take a pet to an EU country after Brexit, there may be changes that affect you.</p>
          <p>You will not be able to use the pet passport scheme after Brexit and the alternative will take 4 months to arrange.</p>
          <p>You should contact your vet for advice at least 4 months before you travel (or as soon as possible). If the UK leaves the EU in a &#39;no deal&#39; situation, you may need to take extra steps in advance.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pet-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> which gives more information on this.</p>
          <h2 id="travelling-as-a-haulier">Travelling as a haulier</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re travelling in Europe as haulier after Brexit, there may be changes to the rules on licences, permits and qualifications which apply to you.</p>
          <p>Hauliers and commercial drivers will need the correct documentation to drive in the EU should the UK leave without a deal.</p>
          <p>Hauliers will be required to go through customs checks, and it&#39;s the responsibility of traders to make sure that the right paperwork is in place provided for the goods being carried.</p>
          <p>More details of what hauliers will need to do is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transport-goods-from-uk-by-road">available at GOV.UK.</a> </p>

          <h3 id="travel-insurance">Travel insurance</h3>
          <p>If you have a European Health Insurance Card, it may not be valid after Brexit. You must make sure that you have suitable insurance and healthcare cover, especially if you have a pre-existing condition.</p>
          <h2 id="driving-in-the-eu">Driving in the EU</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to drive in the EU after Brexit and have a UK Driving Licence, you may need to apply for and carry an International Driving Permit.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> on this.</p>
          <p>You may also need to apply for and carry a Green Card to prove you have third party insurance if you&#39;re driving in:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the EU</li>
          <li>EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway)</li>
          <li>Andorra, Serbia or Switzerland</li>
          </ul>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad">GOV.UK has guidance</a> on this.</p>
          <h2 id="travelling-with-pets">Travelling with pets</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to take a pet to an EU country after Brexit, there may be changes that affect you.</p>
          <p>You will not be able to use the pet passport scheme after Brexit and the alternative will take 4 months to arrange.</p>
          <p>You should contact your vet for advice at least 4 months before you travel (or as soon as possible). If the UK leaves the EU in a &#39;no deal&#39; situation, you may need to take extra steps in advance.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pet-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> which gives more information on this.</p>
          <h2 id="travelling-as-a-haulier">Travelling as a haulier</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re travelling in Europe as haulier after Brexit, there may be changes to the rules on licences, permits and qualifications which apply to you.</p>
          <p>Hauliers and commercial drivers will need the correct documentation to drive in the EU should the UK leave without a deal.</p>
          <p>Hauliers will be required to go through customs checks, and it&#39;s the responsibility of traders to make sure that the right paperwork is in place provided for the goods being carried.</p>
          <p>More details of what hauliers will need to do is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transport-goods-from-uk-by-road">available at GOV.UK.</a> </p>
          <h2 id="more-information">More information</h2>
          <p>More details on travel after Brexit will be added to this page as new information is available.</p>

        hippostd:content: "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p>The UK left the European\
          \ Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as 'Brexit'. </p>\
          \ \n  <p>We're now in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/transition\">transition\
          \ period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that's likely to\
          \ last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still\
          \ following EU rules. </p> \n  <p>In January 2021 the transition period\
          \ will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be\
          \ effects on some areas of life in Scotland.</p> \n  <p>It's still not clear\
          \ what these effects will be. Despite this, the Scottish Government is working\
          \ with the UK Government and public bodies to prepare for possible impacts\
          \ on people and business in Scotland. <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/brexit/\"\
          >Visit the Scottish Government website</a> for more information.</p> \n\
          \  <p>The Scottish Government is looking at two main options for what will\
          \ happen after the transition period ends:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Brexit\
          \ with a trade deal</li> \n   <li>Brexit without a trade deal (a 'no deal'\
          \ situation)</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The UK Government has proposed a trade\
          \ deal. But it has not yet been ratified (confirmed). This means 'no deal'\
          \ could still happen. </p> \n  <p>You may have questions about what Brexit\
          \ means for you. You might have questions about the availability of medicines\
          \ or food, or how EU citizens living in Scotland may be affected.</p> \n\
          \  <p>This site provides information and guidance to help you prepare for\
          \ Brexit, including a 'no deal' situation. Not all information is available\
          \ at this time. Regular updates will be made to this site as new information\
          \ becomes available.</p> \n  <p>Brexit could include changes to a number\
          \ of different things in your day to day life. For more information, select\
