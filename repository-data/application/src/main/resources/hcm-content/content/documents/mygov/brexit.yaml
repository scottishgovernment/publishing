          <p>The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as &#39;Brexit&#39;. </p>
          <p>We&#39;re now in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">transition period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that&#39;s likely to last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still following EU rules. </p>
          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. </p>
          <p>This may include changes to civil rights.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The UK is now in the Brexit transition period. This means many of the details about what Brexit will mean are not yet known. This page gives the latest facts, but it will be updated as more details are confirmed. Please keep checking back for new information. </p>

          <p>Civil rights is a subject devolved to Scotland. These rights are protected under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents">Human Rights Act 1998</a> and in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/contents">Scotland Act 1998.</a> </p>

          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. </p>

          <p>Scotland has measures in place to protect the environment, and these measures are supported by EU laws and standards. These EU laws and standards may be affected by Brexit.</p>

        The UK Government has [published a policy paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/no-deal-immigration-arrangements-for-eu-citizens-moving-to-the-uk-after-brexit/no-deal-immigration-arrangements-for-eu-citizens-arriving-after-brexit) setting out arrangements for EU citizens coming to the UK after Brexit if no deal is reached. Under the proposals, EU citizens who move to the UK for the first time after Brexit will be able to enter the UK as they do now. Their current rights to live, work and study in the UK will continue until 31 December 2020.

          <h2 id="family-law-disputes-involving-eu-countries">Family law disputes involving EU countries</h2>
          <p>If there&#39;s a family dispute where both parties are based in the UK, nothing will change after Brexit except for a small change to when courts in Scotland can deal with divorce cases.</p>
          <p>If a family dispute involves EU countries, however, some of the rules may change after Brexit.</p>
          <p>If we have not agreed an EU trade deal by the end of the Brexit transition period, some EU family law agreements will no longer apply to the UK. </p>
          <p>This will affect rules on:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the country that family law disputes are heard in</li>
          <li>how decisions made in one country will be recognised and enforced in another</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This applies to cases in Scotland for:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>divorce</li>
          <li>matters relating to children</li>
          <li>child maintenance</li>
          <li>EU rules on child abduction</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are involved in a case you think may be affected by this (or if you will be soon), you should speak to a lawyer or <a href="https://www.cas.org.uk/">Citizens Advice Bureau</a> as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>There will be no changes to the process until the end of the transition period (December 2020).</p>

          <p>If there&#39;s a civil or commercial dispute where both parties are based in the UK, nothing will change after Brexit.</p>
          <p>If a dispute involves EU countries, however, some of the rules may change after Brexit.</p>
          <p>If we have not agreed an EU trade deal by the end of the transition period (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), some EU civil law agreements will no longer apply to the UK.</p>
          <p>This will affect rules on:</p>

          <p>If you are currently in a case you think may be affected by this (or you will be soon) you should speak to a lawyer. </p>

          <p>Your current regulatory obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy and marine environment legislation remain in full effect throughout 2020. There are no changes to your operational reporting requirements or obligations. </p>
          <p>If you have any queries about your ongoing obligations, please contact your local fisheries office in the first instance. </p>
          <p>The aim is to conclude an EU-UK Fisheries Agreement by 1 July 2020 and a Free Trade Agreement with the EU by the end of December 2020. Marine Scotland will continue to monitor the progress of the negotiations and how this will impact your business in January 2020. If you have any queries, please <a href="mailto:MARINE.BREXIT@GOV.SCOT">email the Marine Scotland EU hub</a>. </p>
          <p>The EU has different fishing requirements for &#39;third countries&#39; (countries not in the EU). If the transition period ends before an EU trade deal has been agreed (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), Scottish fisheries will have to follow these requirements. </p>

          <li>export non-UK &#39;third country&#39; fish to the EU</li>

          <h2 id="food-supplies">Food supplies</h2>
          <p>While much of the food and drink we have in Scotland is produced within Scotland and the UK, some of it gets imported into the UK from other countries in the EU and beyond.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with retailers, the food industry and others across the supply chain to make sure any disruption to the supply of food and drink will be kept to a minimum.</p>
          <h3 id="if-you-re-struggling-to-afford-food">If you&#39;re struggling to afford food</h3>
          <p>Some families in Scotland struggle to be able to afford or access food. This is also known as &#39;household food insecurity&#39;.</p>
          <p>Brexit may lead to some foods becoming more expensive or harder to find, which may affect those who need the most help.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government continues to look at ways to tackle and respond to food insecurity. This includes increasing the Fair Food Fund to £3.5 million in 2019-20 and investing an extra £1 million in <a href="https://fareshare.org.uk/">food redistribution.</a></p>
          <p>If you&#39;re worried about not being able to afford food, there are a number of ways you can get help. For example, you may be eligible for a <a href="/scottish-welfare-fund/">Scottish Welfare Fund Crisis Grant</a>.</p>
          <p>Citizens Advice Scotland gives <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/foodbanks-and-other-help-in-your-area/">information on support in your area.</a></p>
          <h3 id="exporting-for-food-businesses">Exporting for food businesses</h3>
          <p>If no EU trade deal has been agreed by the end of the Brexit transition period, there are likely to be effects on Scottish food and drink producers who export their goods to EU countries.</p>
          <p>Some of these goods (like beef and lamb) could face large tariffs.</p>
          <p>Others, like seafood, may have other barriers, like additional certification and delays in getting products to market. This could have a financial impact.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is working with the industry and others within the supply chain to assess the effects of this disruption and reduce any impacts.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.prepareforbrexit.scot/">The Prepare for Brexit site</a> is designed to help Scottish businesses prepare for Brexit by explaining what they may need to do to be able to continue exporting to the EU.</p>
          <h2 id="food-safety-and-standards">Food safety and standards</h2>
          <p>Food Standards Scotland is continuing to prepare for Brexit, to make sure that public health is still protected after the Brexit transition period ends.</p>
          <p>Most food law in Scotland currently comes from the EU and makes sure food that comes into the country is safe to eat and drink.</p>
          <p>Food Standards Scotland is working with the Scottish Government and UK Government to make sure the same protections will continue after Brexit.</p>
          <p>It&#39;s also working to make sure the public in Scotland are protected from any possible disruption to the supply chain.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/about-us/brexit">Food Standards Scotland website</a> gives more information on what it&#39;s been doing to prepare for Brexit.</p>

          \ \n  <p>This 'right to rent' legislation does not yet apply to Scotland,\

          <p>Scotland&#39;s justice system and agencies play an important role in:</p>
          <ul>

          <li>investigating crime</li>
          <li>prosecuting crime</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Brexit may have an impact on some parts of the justice system, but the Scottish Government and justice agencies will continue to work to make sure Scotland is safe.</p>
          <p>Scotland has its own legal and judicial system, criminal laws and law enforcement agencies. The Scottish Government handles justice policy, while the Lord Advocate is head of the independent system that investigates and prosecutes crime.</p>
          <p>This justice system helps keep Scotland safe and fair, and it will continue to do this after Brexit.</p>
          <p>Scotland&#39;s prosecution and police services have a strong relationship with justice agencies in countries throughout the EU. Common tools like the European Arrest Warrant and other EU information-sharing measures help law agencies in Scotland and across the EU tackle cross-border crime and terrorism.</p>
          <p>The impact of Brexit may have an effect on how Scotland delivers justice and protects the public. However, the Scottish Government will aim, as far as it is able, to make sure Brexit doesn&#39;t affect Scotland&#39;s cross-border relationship with the EU, so our police and law enforcement agencies can continue fighting cross-border crime.</p>

          <h2 id="local-and-devolved-taxes">Local and devolved taxes</h2>
          <p>There are three types of taxes in Scotland – local taxes, devolved taxes and reserved taxes.</p>
          <p>The taxes managed and collected by local authorities are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>council tax</li>
          <li>non-domestic rates</li>

          <ul>
          <li>Scottish Income Tax (rates and bands only)</li>
          <li>Land and Buildings Transaction Tax</li>

          <li>National Insurance</li>
          <li>Corporation Tax</li>

          <p>Reserved taxes (especially VAT) may change after Brexit. This may impact UK citizens and businesses.</p>

          <p> If the transition period ends before an EU trade deal has been agreed (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), the rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change for UK passport holders.</p>
          <p>If you travel to an EU country after Brexit, you should have at least 6 months left on your passport from the date you arrive. Your passport should also be less than 10 years old.</p>

          <p>If you&#39;re planning to travel by air, sea, coach, rail or Eurotunnel shuttle after Brexit, all these services are expected to run as normal after Brexit. However, you should check with your travel company for the latest information before you leave.</p>
          <p>If any of these services are delayed or cancelled, your consumer rights will remain the same.</p>
          <p>The European Commission has said that there will be no difference to travel and holidaymakers won&#39;t need a visa during the &#39;transition period&#39; (where the UK has left the EU but still follows EU rules while the new arrangements are made).</p>
          <p>You may still need to check your passport is valid for at least six months after the date you plan to travel. If you&#39;re travelling with a pet, or planning to drive in mainland Europe, you may need to make extra arrangements as explained on this page. There are still more details to be agreed – this site will be updated when there&#39;s more information.</p>

          <p>If you have a European Health Insurance Card, it may not be valid after Brexit. You must make sure that you have suitable insurance and healthcare cover, especially if you have a pre-existing condition.</p>
          <h2 id="driving-in-the-eu">Driving in the EU</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to drive in the EU after Brexit and have a UK Driving Licence, you may need to apply for and carry an International Driving Permit.</p>

          <p>Hauliers and commercial drivers will need the correct documentation to drive in the EU should the UK leave without a deal.</p>
          <p>Hauliers will be required to go through customs checks, and it&#39;s the responsibility of traders to make sure that the right paperwork is in place provided for the goods being carried.</p>

          <p>Hauliers and commercial drivers will need the correct documentation to drive in the EU should the UK leave without a deal.</p>
          <p>Hauliers will be required to go through customs checks, and it&#39;s the responsibility of traders to make sure that the right paperwork is in place provided for the goods being carried.</p>
          <p>More details of what hauliers will need to do is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transport-goods-from-uk-by-road">available at GOV.UK.</a> </p>
          <h2 id="more-information">More information</h2>

        hippostd:content: "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p>The UK left the European\
          \ Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as 'Brexit'. </p>\
          \ \n  <p>We're now in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/transition\">transition\
          \ period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that's likely to\
          \ last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still\
          \ following EU rules. </p> \n  <p>In January 2021 the transition period\
          \ will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be\
          \ effects on some areas of life in Scotland.</p> \n  <p>It's still not clear\
          \ what these effects will be. Despite this, the Scottish Government is working\
          \ with the UK Government and public bodies to prepare for possible impacts\
          \ on people and business in Scotland. <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/brexit/\"\
          >Visit the Scottish Government website</a> for more information.</p> \n\
          \  <p>The Scottish Government is looking at two main options for what will\
          \ happen after the transition period ends:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Brexit\
          \ with a trade deal</li> \n   <li>Brexit without a trade deal (a 'no deal'\
          \ situation)</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The UK Government has proposed a trade\
          \ deal. But it has not yet been ratified (confirmed). This means 'no deal'\
          \ could still happen. </p> \n  <p>You may have questions about what Brexit\
          \ means for you. You might have questions about the availability of medicines\
          \ or food, or how EU citizens living in Scotland may be affected.</p> \n\
          \  <p>This site provides information and guidance to help you prepare for\
          \ Brexit, including a 'no deal' situation. Not all information is available\
          \ at this time. Regular updates will be made to this site as new information\
          \ becomes available.</p> \n  <p>Brexit could include changes to a number\
          \ of different things in your day to day life. For more information, select\

        hippostd:content: "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p>The UK left the European\
          \ Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as 'Brexit'. </p>\
          \ \n  <p>We're now in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/transition\">transition\
          \ period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that's likely to\
          \ last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still\
          \ following EU rules. </p> \n  <p>In January 2021 the transition period\
          \ will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be\
          \ effects on some areas of life in Scotland.</p> \n  <p>It's still not clear\
          \ what these effects will be. Despite this, the Scottish Government is working\
          \ with the UK Government and public bodies to prepare for possible impacts\
          \ on people and business in Scotland. <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/brexit/\"\
          >Visit the Scottish Government website</a> for more information.</p> \n\
          \  <p>The Scottish Government is looking at two main options for what will\
          \ happen after the transition period ends:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Brexit\
          \ with a trade deal</li> \n   <li>Brexit without a trade deal (a 'no deal'\
          \ situation)</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The UK Government has proposed a trade\
          \ deal. But it has not yet been ratified (confirmed). This means 'no deal'\
          \ could still happen. </p> \n  <p>You may have questions about what Brexit\
          \ means for you. You might have questions about the availability of medicines\
          \ or food, or how EU citizens living in Scotland may be affected.</p> \n\
          \  <p>This site provides information and guidance to help you prepare for\
          \ Brexit, including a 'no deal' situation. Not all information is available\
          \ at this time. Regular updates will be made to this site as new information\
          \ becomes available.</p> \n  <p>Brexit could include changes to a number\
