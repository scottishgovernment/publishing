Benefit Delivery Quality Framework 

Social Security Scotland

Foreword 
 
The Social Security Scotland Corporate Plan and Social Security Scotland Charter 
set a strategic objective of being a high-quality, learning service.  All employees of 
Social Security are responsible for delivering a quality service, that pay clients their 
correct entitlement whilst providing an efficient, value for money service and 
protecting public funds by minimising fraud and error. 
  
This Quality Framework for Benefit Delivery establishes the high level standards and 
approaches required to achieve this. Each Benefit will operationalise the framework 
to support improved performance in their areas. Further work will be undertaken to 
expand the framework to wider Social Security Scotland. 
 

Background 
 
The Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 outlines the duty placed upon Scottish 
Ministers to ensure that individuals are given assistance to what they are entitled to. 
The Scottish Public Finance Manual  requires the Scottish Government to deliver 
continuous improvement in performance whilst maintaining an appropriate balance 
between quality and cost. 
 
Social Security Scotland developed its Charter and includes key elements related to 
quality:  

• Make decisions in a way that is consistent and accurate – and aim to get them 
right first time 

• Pay clients the right amount, on time  

• Make sure our people are well trained, supported and equipped to do their jobs 
 
To deliver our statutory and charter obligations, Social Security Scotland published  
its  Error Control Strategy. The Quality Framework for Benefit Delivery, ensures a 
standard approach to monitoring quality that maintains the right standards and drives 
continuous improvement.

Robust, in-depth guidance & processes: Careful consideration is given to provide 
clear guidance products and to ensure ease of use for our colleagues and partners; 
and is subject to careful controls and extensive user testing to refine these over time. 

 
System controls: We will continually develop preventative controls to ensure that 
opportunities for error to occur are reduced wherever possible, ensuring that the 
benefits being devolved are secure by design, while also minimising impact on the 
customer journey and delivering value for money. 

 
Automation: Social Security Scotland will seek to maximise opportunities to 
automate processes to reduce user error risk and allow resources to be focused on 
more complex areas that require user intervention to ensure accurate outcomes. 

 
Change management: Social Security Scotland will ensure that Benefit launches 
and Change Initiatives are fully impacted from a quality perspective and that 
payment error risks are identified, with mitigation and resolution plans in place if 
issue cannot be fully resolved prior to implementation. 

Bespoke Quality strategy: Each business area will outline how they will assure and 
embed quality within their area to prevent error. This will outline the ongoing 
measures, controls, and feedback loops within their area, aligning with PILLARS 
model.
