            <p>Exporting helps Scotland’s economy to grow and creates jobs. It helps the Scottish Government collect more tax to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>improve living standards</li>
            <li>improve public services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Exporting also helps Scotland build good relationships with other countries. This can help Scotland to have a positive influence on the world.</p>
            <h2>How exporting helps businesses</h2>
            <p>Exporting helps businesses to grow because it:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>leads them to create new products and services</li>
            <li>makes them more productive</li>
            <li>gives them more customers to sell to</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>New products and services</h2>
            <p>Exporting can mean that businesses have more competitors.</p>
            <p>But this can be a positive thing and can lead them to develop new products and services.</p>
            <p>Businesses that export tend to spend more money on research and development. This helps them to develop new products and services to sell.</p>
            <h2>Improving productivity</h2>
            <p>Exporting helps businesses to become more productive. This means they produce more with the same amount of resources.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/">Office of National Statistics</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy">Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</a> say:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>businesses that export make up 60% of the UK’s annual increase in productivity</li>
            <li>the 3% of businesses in Scotland that export are on average 70% more productive than businesses that do not</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>More customers to sell to</h2>
            <p>Exporting also means businesses do not have to rely on a particular set of customers. This helps businesses to spread any risks.</p>
            <p>For example, if sales drop in one market, the risk to their business might be less if they have other markets they sell to.</p>
            <h2>Scotland’s export growth plan</h2>
            <p>Because exporting is important to Scotland and its businesses, the Scottish Government has created an export growth plan. This plan is called <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/">A Trading Nation</a>.</p>

              <p class="ds_leader leader">In 2017, Scotland sold £5.5 billion worth of exports to the United States of America (USA). This is 17.1% of Scotland’s total international exports. Between 2013 and 2017, Scottish exports to the USA increased by an average of 4.6% each year.</p>

              <h2>The benefits of selling to the USA</h2>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings">World Bank</a> rates the USA as the 8th easiest country in the world to do business with.</p>

              <p>The USA’s a good place to export to because it:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>has well defined and established laws</li>
               <li>does not have a lot of regulations which can cause barriers for trade</li>
               <li>has few language barriers</li>
              </ul>

              <p>It’s also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:</p>

              <ul>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings">World Bank</a> rates Canada as the 22nd easiest country in the world to do business with.</p>

              <p>Canada’s a good place to export to because it has a:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>strong economy</li>
               <li>highly educated workforce</li>
              </ul>

              <p>It’s also a good place for Scottish businesses to export to because:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>Canada is a bilingual country where English is one the 2 languages spoken</li>
               <li>it has similar laws and regulations as the UK</li>
               <li>it has a high standard of living, so people have money to spend</li>
              </ul>

            \ Nation organises countries into 3 priority groups.</p> \n  <h3>Priority\
            \ group 1</h3> \n  <p>The 15 countries in the first priority group are:</p>\
            \ \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"usa\">United States of America</a></li>\

            re expected to provide the most opportunity for Scotland’s future export\
            \ growth.</p> \n  <p>To help exports to these countries, we’ll put in\
            \ place support including:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Scottish Development\

            \ up 14% of Scotland’s exports. These countries are expected to provide\
            \ opportunities for businesses in:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>the mid to long\
            \ term</li> \n   <li>specific sectors</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>To help exports\

            \ network</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2>How countries were chosen</h2> \n  <p>Each\
            \ country was chosen based on evidence. This evidence drew on a range\
            \ of sources that looked at:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>how much Scotland currently\
            \ exports there</li> \n   <li>how we think exports there could increase\

            >A Trading Nation</a> aims to increase Scotland’s exports by:</p> \n \
            \ <ul> \n   <li>focussing resources</li> \n   <li>making changes to strategy</li>\
            \ \n   <li>making changes to policy</li> \n   <li>checking how exports\
            \ perform</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2>Focussing resources</h2> \n  <p>Scotland\
            \ will increase exports by focussing resources where they will have most\
            \ impact.</p> \n  <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
            >evidence shows</a> that successful exporting countries:</p> \n  <ul>\
            \ \n   <li>focus on a limited range of products and services</li> \n \
            \  <li>sell to a limited number of countries</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This\
            \ is why <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
            >A Trading Nation</a> focusses on <a href=\"index\">key sectors</a> and\
            \ <a href=\"index\">countries</a>.</p> \n  <h2>Top 500 businesses</h2>\
            \ \n  <p>Scotland will also focus its resources around its top 500 exporting\
            \ businesses.</p> \n  <p>Scotland currently has around 11,000 businesses\
            \ who export. However, the top 500 are responsible for 80% of exports.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>Increasing exports for the top 500 businesses could add £13 billion\
            \ to Scotland’s economy (Gross Domestic Product), while increasing exports\
            \ in the other 10,500 businesses would only add £2.9 billion.</p> \n \
            \ <p>Increasing exports for these businesses will also benefit the businesses\
            \ who supply them.</p> \n  <h2>Help for new exporters</h2> \n  <p>All\
            \ businesses in Scotland will still be able to get some <a href=\"help-for-businesses\"\
            >help to grow their business and start exporting</a>. This includes businesses\
            \ who are new to exporting.</p> \n  <p>We’re looking at ways we can deliver\
            \ this help in a different way. For example, improving the help and support\
            \ available online.</p> \n  <h2>Working together</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"\

            >A Trading Nation</a> aims to increase Scotland’s exports by:</p> \n \
            \ <ul> \n   <li>focussing resources</li> \n   <li>making changes to strategy</li>\
            \ \n   <li>making changes to policy</li> \n   <li>checking how exports\
            \ perform</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2>Focussing resources</h2> \n  <p>Scotland\
            \ will increase exports by focussing resources where they will have most\
            \ impact.</p> \n  <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
            >evidence shows</a> that successful exporting countries:</p> \n  <ul>\
            \ \n   <li>focus on a limited range of products and services</li> \n \
            \  <li>sell to a limited number of countries</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This\
            \ is why <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
            >A Trading Nation</a> focusses on <a href=\"index\">key sectors</a> and\
            \ <a href=\"index\">countries</a>.</p> \n  <h2>Top 500 businesses</h2>\
            \ \n  <p>Scotland will also focus its resources around its top 500 exporting\
            \ businesses.</p> \n  <p>Scotland currently has around 11,000 businesses\
            \ who export. However, the top 500 are responsible for 80% of exports.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>Increasing exports for the top 500 businesses could add £13 billion\
            \ to Scotland’s economy (Gross Domestic Product), while increasing exports\
            \ in the other 10,500 businesses would only add £2.9 billion.</p> \n \
            \ <p>Increasing exports for these businesses will also benefit the businesses\
            \ who supply them.</p> \n  <h2>Help for new exporters</h2> \n  <p>All\
            \ businesses in Scotland will still be able to get some <a href=\"help-for-businesses\"\
            >help to grow their business and start exporting</a>. This includes businesses\
            \ who are new to exporting.</p> \n  <p>We’re looking at ways we can deliver\
            \ this help in a different way. For example, improving the help and support\
            \ available online.</p> \n  <h2>Working together</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"\
            https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\">A Trading\
            \ Nation</a> will also focus resources by encouraging organisations to\
            \ work together on the plan’s priorities. This includes:</p> \n  <ul>\
            \ \n   <li>the Scottish Government</li> \n   <li>the enterprise agencies</li>\
            \ \n   <li>agencies supporting education, tourism and specific industry\
            \ sectors</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>By working together, it means businesses\
            \ can make use of:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/about-sdi/global-offices\"\
            >Scottish Development International offices</a> in 20 countries</li> \n\

            \ \n   <li>Visit Scotland offices in London and Toronto</li> \n  </ul>\
            \ \n  <p>Businesses will also be able to access wider networks and trade\
            \ and investment specialists across the world. A Trading Nation will use\
            \ help from:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.globalscot.com/\"\

            >A Trading Nation</a> makes changes to strategy and policy.</p> \n  <p>These\
            \ changes aim to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>raise awareness of exporting and\
            \ encourage businesses to see it as an ambition</li> \n   <li>build the\
            \ capacity and capabilities of businesses, so they can take up opportunities</li>\
            \ \n   <li>make sure the right support is available to help businesses\
            \ expand and exploit opportunities</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>To do this, <a\
            \ href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
            >A Trading Nation</a> will:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>improve trade promotion\
            \ as well as Scotland’s overseas profile and reach</li> \n   <li>support\
            \ businesses by refocussing <a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\">Scottish\
