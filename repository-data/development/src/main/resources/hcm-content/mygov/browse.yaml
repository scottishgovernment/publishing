                <p>The&nbsp;<strong>plains zebra</strong>&nbsp;(<em>Equus quagga</em>, formerly&nbsp;<em>Equus burchellii</em>), also known as the&nbsp;<strong>common zebra</strong>, is the most common and geographically widespread species of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra" title="Zebra">zebra</a>. Its range is fragmented, but spans much of southern and eastern Africa south of the Sahara. Six&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Subspecies">subspecies</a>&nbsp;have been recognised including the extinct&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quagga" title="Quagga">quagga</a>&nbsp;which was thought to be a separate species. However, more recent research supports variations in zebra populations being&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology)" title="Cline (biology)">clines</a>&nbsp;rather than subspecies.</p>

                <p>The plains zebra is intermediate in size between the larger&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A9vy%27s_zebra" title="Grévy's zebra">Grévy's zebra</a>&nbsp;and the smaller&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_zebra" title="Mountain zebra">mountain zebra</a>; and tends to have broader stripes than both. Great variation in coat patterns exists between clines and individuals. The plain zebra's habitat is generally, but not exclusively, treeless grasslands and savanna woodlands, both tropical and temperate. They generally avoid desert, dense rainforest, and permanent wetlands. Zebras are preyed upon by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion" title="Lion">lions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_hyena" title="Spotted hyena">spotted hyenas</a>&nbsp;and to a lesser extent&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile" title="Nile crocodile">crocodiles</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah" title="Cheetah">cheetahs</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_dog" title="African wild dog">African wild dogs</a>. The plains zebra is a highly social species, forming harems with a single&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stallion" title="Stallion">stallion</a>, several&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare" title="Mare">mares</a>, and their recent offspring; bachelor groups also form. Groups may come together to form herds. The animals keep watch for predators; they bark or snort when they see a predator, and the harem stallion attacks predators to defend his harem.</p>

            <p><strong>Bats</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" title="Mammal">mammals</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)" title="Order (biology)">order</a>&nbsp;<strong>Chiroptera</strong>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat#cite_note-2">[a]</a></sup>&nbsp;With their forelimbs adapted as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing" title="Wing">wings</a>, they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight" title="Flight">flight</a>. Bats are more manoeuvrable than&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" title="Bird">birds</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_flight" title="Bat flight">flying</a>&nbsp;with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin" title="Skin">membrane</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagium" title="Patagium">patagium</a>. The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitti%27s_hog-nosed_bat" title="Kitti's hog-nosed bat">Kitti's hog-nosed bat</a>, which is 29–34 millimetres (1&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>–1&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>&nbsp;inches) in length, 150&nbsp;mm (6&nbsp;in) across the wings and 2–2.6&nbsp;g (<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub>–<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>32</sub>&nbsp;oz) in mass. The largest bats are the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_fox#Physical_characteristics" title="Flying fox">flying foxes</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_golden-crowned_flying_fox" title="Giant golden-crowned flying fox">giant golden-crowned flying fox</a>,&nbsp;<em>Acerodon jubatus</em>, which can weigh 1.6&nbsp;kg (3&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;lb) and have a wingspan of 1.7&nbsp;m (5&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in).</p>

            <p>The second largest order of mammals after&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodents" title="Rodents">rodents</a>, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with over 1,400 species. These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely fruit-eating&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabat" title="Megabat">megabats</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_echolocation" title="Animal echolocation">echolocating</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbat" title="Microbat">microbats</a>. But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinpterochiroptera" title="Yinpterochiroptera">Yinpterochiroptera</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangochiroptera" title="Yangochiroptera">Yangochiroptera</a>, with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats. Many bats are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore" title="Insectivore">insectivores</a>, and most of the rest are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugivore" title="Frugivore">frugivores</a>&nbsp;(fruit-eaters) or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectarivore" title="Nectarivore">nectarivores</a>&nbsp;(nectar-eaters). A few species feed on animals other than insects; for example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_bat" title="Vampire bat">vampire bats</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematophagy" title="Hematophagy">feed on blood</a>. Most bats are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal" title="Nocturnal">nocturnal</a>, and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator" title="Predator">predators</a>. Bats are present throughout the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions. They are important in their ecosystems for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollinator" title="Pollinator">pollinating</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower" title="Flower">flowers</a>&nbsp;and dispersing seeds; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services.</p>

            <p>Bats provide humans with some direct benefits, at the cost of some disadvantages. On the benefits side, bat dung has been and in many places still is mined as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guano" title="Guano">guano</a>&nbsp;from caves and used as fertiliser. Bats consume insect pests, reducing the need for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticides</a>&nbsp;and other insect management measures. They are sometimes numerous enough and close enough to human settlements to serve as tourist attractions, and they are used as food across Asia and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Rim" title="Pacific Rim">Pacific Rim</a>. On the disadvantages side, fruit bats are frequently considered a pest by fruit growers. Due to their physiology, bats are one type of animal that acts as a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir" title="Natural reservoir">natural reservoir</a>&nbsp;of many&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen" title="Pathogen">pathogens</a>, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies" title="Rabies">rabies</a>; and since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread disease among themselves. If humans interact with bats, these traits become potentially dangerous to humans.</p>

            <p>Depending on the culture, bats may be symbolically associated with positive traits, such as protection from certain diseases or risks, rebirth, or long life, but in the West, bats are popularly associated with the superhero&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a>, darkness, malevolence, witchcraft,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire" title="Vampire">vampires</a>, and death.</p>

              <p>All are entirely&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal" title="Aquatic animal">aquatic</a>, lacking the broad belly-scales found in most other snakes and possessing dorsally located eyes. Their most notable feature is their skin and scales. The skin is loose and baggy, giving the impression of being several sizes too large for the snake, and the scales, rather than overlapping, are tiny pyramidal projections that led to their common names.</p>

              <p>These snakes are ambush predators, lurking at the bottom of rivers, streams and estuaries, and waiting for fish to approach, which they grip with their coils. The rough scales allow them to hold the fish despite the mucus coating. Adults grow to between 60&nbsp;cm and 2.43&nbsp;m in length.</p>

            <p>Albatrosses have been described as "the most legendary of all birds".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross#cite_note-delhoyo-39">[39]</a></sup>&nbsp;An albatross is the central emblem in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner" title="The Rime of the Ancient Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a></em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge" title="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>, representing the innocence and beauty of God's creation.

A widespread&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_legend" title="Urban legend">myth</a>&nbsp;holds that sailors believe shooting or harming an albatross is disastrous, due in part to the poem; in truth, sailors regularly killed and ate them,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross#cite_note-Brit-24">[24]</a></sup>&nbsp;as reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook" title="James Cook">James Cook</a>&nbsp;in 1772.

            <h3>In culture</h3>

            <p>Albatrosses have been described as "the most legendary of all birds".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross#cite_note-delhoyo-39">[39]</a></sup>&nbsp;An albatross is the central emblem in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner" title="The Rime of the Ancient Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a></em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge" title="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>, representing the innocence and beauty of God's creation. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross_(metaphor)" title="Albatross (metaphor)">albatross metaphor</a>&nbsp;is derived from this poem; someone bearing a burden or facing an obstacle is said to have "an albatross around his neck", the punishment given to the mariner who killed the albatross. A widespread&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_legend" title="Urban legend">myth</a>&nbsp;holds that sailors believe shooting or harming an albatross is disastrous, due in part to the poem; in truth, sailors regularly killed and ate them,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross#cite_note-Brit-24">[24]</a></sup>&nbsp;as reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook" title="James Cook">James Cook</a>&nbsp;in 1772. However, other sailors reportedly caught the birds but let them free again, possibly believing that albatrosses were the souls of lost sailors,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>&nbsp;so killing them would bring bad luck.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross#cite_note-AICH-44">[44]</a></sup>&nbsp;The head of an albatross being caught with a hook is used as the emblem of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Horner" title="Cape Horner">Cape Horners</a>, i.e. sailors who have rounded&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Horn" title="Cape Horn">Cape Horn</a>&nbsp;on freighters under sail; captains of such ships even received themselves the title "albatrosses" in the Cape Horners' organisation.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross#cite_note-AICH-44">[44]</a></sup></p>

            <p>A captive albatross tormented by jeering sailors is also a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a>&nbsp;for the social travails of the sensitive&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po%C3%A8te_maudit" title="Poète maudit">poète maudit</a>&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Baudelaire" title="Charles Baudelaire">Charles Baudelaire</a>'s poem&nbsp;<em>L'Albatros</em>:</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Le Poète est semblable au prince des nuées</p>

            <p>Qui hante la tempête et se rit de l'archer;</p>

            <p>Exilé sur le sol au milieu des huées,</p>

            <p>Ses ailes de géant l'empêchent de marcher.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>(The poet is like this prince of the clouds, who haunts the storm and mocks the archer; but exiled on earth surrounded by jeers, his giant wings make him helpless to walk.)</p>

            <p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf" title="Golf">golf</a>, shooting three under par on a single hole has recently been termed scoring an "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross_(golf)" title="Albatross (golf)">albatross</a>", as a continuation on the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)" title="Par (score)">birdie and eagle</a>&nbsp;theme.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup></p>

              <p>If your tenant started renting from you on or after 1 December 2017, they're likely to have a private residential tenancy.</p>

              <p>If the tenancy started before 1 December 2017 they don't have a private residential tenancy unless you changed their tenancy to a private residential tenancy on or after 1 December 2017.</p>

              <h3>How to use this notice</h3>

              <p>You can fill in your details after pressing 'start'. Once you're finished, you can download a complete Rent Increase Notice that you can give to your tenant.</p>

              <p>The law says that you need to give your tenant this notice if you want to increase their rent. If your tenant has a private residential tenancy, you cannot use any other form of notice to tell them about a rent increase. For example, you cannot use a letter.</p>

              <p>When you download your finished Rent Increase Notice the download will also include 2 sets of notes. These are:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>Guidance Notes for Landlords - these explain the process of making an increase to your tenant's rent</li>
               <li>Guidance Notes for Tenants - these explain the rent increase process to your tenant and you should pass these notes on to them</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>You must give your tenant 3 months' notice</h3>

              <p>It's the law that you must give your tenant at least 3 months' notice before you charge them a higher rent.</p>

              <p>If you're giving your tenant this notice by email or post, you'll also need to give them 2 days to get it.</p>

              <h3>Joint tenants</h3>

              <p>You can give one Rent Increase Notice to 2 or more tenants as long as:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>they have a joint tenancy</li>
               <li>you add all their names to the Rent Increase Notice you give them</li>
              </ul>

              <p>If your tenants don't have a joint tenancy you will need to give each tenant their own Rent Increase Notice.</p>

              <h3>Rent pressure zones</h3>

              <p>If property you're letting is in a <a href="rent-pressure-zone-checker">rent pressure zone</a> it means there's a limit on how much you can increase your tenant's rent.</p>

              <p>As part of this form we'll check:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>whether the property you're letting is in a rent pressure zone</li>
               <li>how this affects the rent increase you want to make</li>

              </div>

              <p>A tenancy agreement is a contract between you and your tenant. It covers things like safety, payment of rent and house rules.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>As a landlord, you must give your tenant all the terms of their private residential tenancy in writing. If you don't you'll be breaking the law.</p>

              <p>Most private tenancies started on or after 1 December 2017 will be private residential tenancies. Information about private residential tenancies can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/private-residential-tenancies-landlords-guide/">Scottish Government's guidance for landlords</a>.</p>

              <h2>Get a private residential tenancy agreement</h2>

              <p>You can use this form to create a Scottish Government Model Tenancy Agreement (MTA) for a private residential tenancy. The MTA includes:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>a tenancy agreement</li>
               <li>all the terms you need to give your tenant</li>
              </ul>

              <p>See a read-only example of the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-government-model-private-residential-tenancy-agreement/">Scottish Government Model Tenancy Agreement</a>.</p>

              <p>To use the MTA you'll need to enter:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>your details</li>
               <li>the details of your tenant or tenants</li>
               <li>details about rental payments and your property</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The form also includes 2 sets of terms.</p>

              <p>One is known as 'must-include terms'. You'll need to give your tenant a copy of these terms if you're using the MTA. These cover the:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>rights of you and your tenant</li>
               <li>legal rules you both need to follow</li>
              </ul>

              <p>You cannot change or edit these terms if you use the MTA.</p>

              <p>A tenancy agreement is a contract between you and your tenant. It covers things like safety, payment of rent and house rules.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>As a landlord, you must give your tenant all the terms of their private residential tenancy in writing. If you don't you'll be breaking the law.</p>

              <p>Most private tenancies started on or after 1 December 2017 will be private residential tenancies. Information about private residential tenancies can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/private-residential-tenancies-landlords-guide/">Scottish Government's guidance for landlords</a>.</p>

              <h2>Get a private residential tenancy agreement</h2>

              <p>The form also includes 2 sets of terms.</p>

              <p>One is known as 'must-include terms'. You'll need to give your tenant a copy of these terms if you're using the MTA. These cover the:</p>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.gov.scot/lettingagentcodeofpractice">Letting Agent Code of Practice</a> (the Code) began on 31 January 2018.</p>

              <p>This is a set of rules that all letting agents must follow to make sure they give a good service to landlords and tenants.</p>

              <p>The Code explains the minimum standards a letting agent must meet when:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>dealing with landlords</li>
               <li>marketing and advertising a property</li>
               <li>managing a let</li>
               <li>collecting rent</li>
               <li>handling repairs</li>
               <li>ending a tenancy</li>
              </ul>

              <p>If you're a landlord the Code will help you understand what you should expect when you're using a letting agent. It will also help you challenge them if you don't think they're meeting the standards in the Code.</p>

              <p>Your letting agent must make you aware of the Code and give you a copy if you ask for it.</p>

              <h2>Register of Letting Agents</h2>

              <p>Everyone who wants to carry out letting agency work in Scotland needs to be registered before they can do this legally. The Scottish Letting Agent Register (the Register) is run by the Scottish Government.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>It is against the law for a person to do letting agency work if they are not on the Register.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <p>Letting agents cannot carry out letting agency work until their application to the Register has been approved.&nbsp;This is different to landlord registration, where a landlord is allowed to let property while their application to the Landlord Register is pending.</p>

              <p>Before they can add an agent to the Register, the Scottish Ministers will have to decide whether the people in charge of a business applying to the register are 'fit and proper' persons to carry out letting agency work. Certain key people working in the business also need to have had a minimum standard of training.</p>

              <p>To decide if someone is a ‘fit and proper’ person, Scottish Ministers will consider all the circumstances of the case including any material showing that the person has been convicted of offences involving fraud, violence, drugs or firearms or a sexual offence.</p>

              <p>Scottish Ministers will also consider whether the person has broken any housing, landlord and tenant or debt laws or failed to comply with the Code.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>You can <a href="https://lettingagentregistration.gov.scot/">check if the letting agent you use (or are thinking of using) is allowed to carry out letting agency work</a>.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <p>If they're a registered letting agent, they'll have a unique letting agent registration number that they must put on all their communications and advertising. You can&nbsp;use this number to check whether they're registered. You can also search the Register using the letting agent's name.</p>

              <h2>Refused and revoked agents</h2>

              <p>If the Scottish Ministers are not satisfied that an agent meets the requirements to be registered, they must refuse to add them to the Register or, if they are already on the Register but no longer meet the requirements, revoke their registration.</p>

              <p>Where the Scottish Ministers refuse to enter an agent in the Register or revoke an agent’s existing entry, this fact will be shown on the Register for 12 months after the date of&nbsp;final refusal.</p>

              <p>You can <a href="https://register.lettingagentregistration.gov.scot/refused-and-revoked">check the Register for a list of refused and revoked agents</a>.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>Once an agent’s registration has been refused or revoked, they cannot get back any costs or charges incurred relating to letting agency work carried out in the period after the date their registration was refused or revoked.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <h2>Removed agents</h2>

              <p>Agents must renew their Registration every 3 years. Agents will be taken off the Register if they do not renew their registration before the deadline, or if Scottish Ministers decide the agent is no longer carrying out letting agency work.

              <h2>If you have a problem with your letting agent</h2>

              <p>If you're a landlord and you have a letting agent managing your property, there are a number of things you can do if you aren't happy with their work.</p>

              <h3>Check your contract</h3>

              <p>The first thing you should do is look at the 'terms of business' or business contract you have with your letting agent. The Code of Practice says that agents must agree with the landlord what services they will provide and give the landlord a copy of the agreement.</p>

              <p>This should give details of the agreement you made with your agent on how they'll manage your property.</p>

              <p>It will explain the services the agent will carry out for you, as well as how much authority they have to act on your behalf without checking with you first.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>If there's a certain part of your letting agent's services you're unhappy with, you may want to ask them for their policy or procedure for that specific service.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <p>The Code says that all agents must have specific procedures for a number of different parts of their work.</p>

              <h3>Check the Code of Practice</h3>

              <p>Your letting agent has to follow the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/lettingagentcodeofpractice">Letting Agent Code of Practice</a> from 31 January 2018.</p>

              <p>If you are not&nbsp;happy with the way they're carrying out certain work on your behalf, check what the Code says about that service.</p>

              <p>If your agent has failed to do what the Code says is required of them, you can make a formal complaint.</p>

              <h3>Make a formal complaint</h3>

              <p>You can make a formal complaint to your letting agent if you believe they've failed to either:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>do what they agreed to in their 'terms of business' or business contract, or</li>
               <li>follow the rules of the Letting Agent Code of Practice</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The Code says that all agents must have a written complaints procedure. If you don't know your agent's procedure, they should be able to give you it.</p>

              <p>Your complaint should be in writing, and you will need to give the agent a reasonable amount of time to respond.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>If your letting agent belongs to a professional organisation or redress scheme (dispute resolution service), you may also want to make a complaint to them.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <h3>Apply to the housing tribunal</h3>

              <p>If you think your letting agent has failed to comply with the Code of Practice and you can't resolve the problem with them through their complaints procedure (or they don't respond within a reasonable time), you can take your complaint further.</p>

              <p>You can do this by making an application to the <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/">First-tier Tribunal for Scotland (Housing and Property Chamber).</a></p>

              <p>All letting agents must comply with the Code from 31 January 2018. The Tribunal will consider applications relating to any failure to comply with the Code which took place after this date.</p>

              <p>More information on applying to the Housing and Property Chamber is available on <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/">the Tribunal website.</a></p>

              <p>You can still take a case to the Tribunal against a letting agent who you think has failed to comply with the Code, even if they no longer manage your property, as long as the complaint is about something that happened after 31 January 2018.</p>

              <p>There's no fee to make an application to the Tribunal. The Tribunal will be informal and the proceedings will be flexible to help resolve issues.</p>

              <p>You don't need a lawyer to represent you – you can do it yourself, or ask someone else, like a friend of family member, to help you. You can also bring along someone to act as a supporter for you – they can, for example, give you moral support, take notes for you or help manage your documents.</p>

              <p>If the Tribunal agrees with your complaint, they can issue a 'Letting Agent Enforcement Order'. This instructs the letting agent to carry out a set of steps to fix the problem and make sure they're following the Code.</p>

              <p>It's against the law for a letting agent to not follow the instructions of an enforcement order. They can be prosecuted if they ignore it.</p>

              <p>The Tribunal will also let Scottish Ministers know if the letting agent hasn't carried out the order. The agent could be banned from doing any more letting agency work.</p>

              <p>All Tribunal decisions will be published on <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/apply-tribunal/letting-agents/letting-agents-decisions">the Tribunal website</a>, along with information about any enforcement order. You can search on the Tribunal website to see whether there have been cases about a specific letting agent.</p>

              <p>If you're a landlord and you have a letting agent managing your property, there are a number of things you can do if you aren't happy with their work.</p>

              <h3>Check your contract</h3>

              <p>The first thing you should do is look at the 'terms of business' or business contract you have with your letting agent. The Code of Practice says that agents must agree with the landlord what services they will provide and give the landlord a copy of the agreement.</p>

              <p>This should give details of the agreement you made with your agent on how they'll manage your property.</p>

              <p>It will explain the services the agent will carry out for you, as well as how much authority they have to act on your behalf without checking with you first.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>If there's a certain part of your letting agent's services you're unhappy with, you may want to ask them for their policy or procedure for that specific service.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <p>The Code says that all agents must have specific procedures for a number of different parts of their work.</p>

              <h3>Check the Code of Practice</h3>

              <p>Your letting agent has to follow the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/lettingagentcodeofpractice">Letting Agent Code of Practice</a> from 31 January 2018.</p>

              <p>If you are not&nbsp;happy with the way they're carrying out certain work on your behalf, check what the Code says about that service.</p>

              <p>If your agent has failed to do what the Code says is required of them, you can make a formal complaint.</p>

              <h3>Make a formal complaint</h3>

              <p>You can make a formal complaint to your letting agent if you believe they've failed to either:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>do what they agreed to in their 'terms of business' or business contract, or</li>
               <li>follow the rules of the Letting Agent Code of Practice</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The Code says that all agents must have a written complaints procedure. If you don't know your agent's procedure, they should be able to give you it.</p>

              <p>Your complaint should be in writing, and you will need to give the agent a reasonable amount of time to respond.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>If your letting agent belongs to a professional organisation or redress scheme (dispute resolution service), you may also want to make a complaint to them.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <h3>Apply to the housing tribunal</h3>

              <p>If you think your letting agent has failed to comply with the Code of Practice and you can't resolve the problem with them through their complaints procedure (or they don't respond within a reasonable time), you can take your complaint further.</p>

              <p>You can do this by making an application to the <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/">First-tier Tribunal for Scotland (Housing and Property Chamber).</a></p>

              <p>All letting agents must comply with the Code from 31 January 2018. The Tribunal will consider applications relating to any failure to comply with the Code which took place after this date.</p>

              <p>More information on applying to the Housing and Property Chamber is available on <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/">the Tribunal website.</a></p>

              <p>You can still take a case to the Tribunal against a letting agent who you think has failed to comply with the Code, even if they no longer manage your property, as long as the complaint is about something that happened after 31 January 2018.</p>

              <p>There's no fee to make an application to the Tribunal. The Tribunal will be informal and the proceedings will be flexible to help resolve issues.</p>

              <p>You don't need a lawyer to represent you – you can do it yourself, or ask someone else, like a friend of family member, to help you. You can also bring along someone to act as a supporter for you – they can, for example, give you moral support, take notes for you or help manage your documents.</p>

              <p>If the Tribunal agrees with your complaint, they can issue a 'Letting Agent Enforcement Order'. This instructs the letting agent to carry out a set of steps to fix the problem and make sure they're following the Code.</p>

              <p>It's against the law for a letting agent to not follow the instructions of an enforcement order. They can be prosecuted if they ignore it.</p>

              <p>The Tribunal will also let Scottish Ministers know if the letting agent hasn't carried out the order. The agent could be banned from doing any more letting agency work.</p>

              <p>All Tribunal decisions will be published on <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/apply-tribunal/letting-agents/letting-agents-decisions">the Tribunal website</a>, along with information about any enforcement order. You can search on the Tribunal website to see whether there have been cases about a specific letting agent.</p>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.gov.scot/lettingagentcodeofpractice">Letting Agent Code of Practice</a> (the Code) began on 31 January 2018.</p>

              <p>This is a set of rules that all letting agents must follow to make sure they give a good service to landlords and tenants.</p>

              <p>The Code explains the minimum standards a letting agent must meet when:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>dealing with landlords</li>
               <li>marketing and advertising a property</li>
               <li>managing a let</li>
               <li>collecting rent</li>
               <li>handling repairs</li>
               <li>ending a tenancy</li>
              </ul>

              <p>If you're a landlord the Code will help you understand what you should expect when you're using a letting agent. It will also help you challenge them if you don't think they're meeting the standards in the Code.</p>

              <p>Your letting agent must make you aware of the Code and give you a copy if you ask for it.</p>

              <h2>Register of Letting Agents</h2>

              <p>Everyone who wants to carry out letting agency work in Scotland needs to be registered before they can do this legally. The Scottish Letting Agent Register (the Register) is run by the Scottish Government.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>It is against the law for a person to do letting agency work if they are not on the Register.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <p>Letting agents cannot carry out letting agency work until their application to the Register has been approved.&nbsp;This is different to landlord registration, where a landlord is allowed to let property while their application to the Landlord Register is pending.</p>

              <p>Before they can add an agent to the Register, the Scottish Ministers will have to decide whether the people in charge of a business applying to the register are 'fit and proper' persons to carry out letting agency work. Certain key people working in the business also need to have had a minimum standard of training.</p>

              <p>To decide if someone is a ‘fit and proper’ person, Scottish Ministers will consider all the circumstances of the case including any material showing that the person has been convicted of offences involving fraud, violence, drugs or firearms or a sexual offence.</p>

              <p>Scottish Ministers will also consider whether the person has broken any housing, landlord and tenant or debt laws or failed to comply with the Code.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>You can <a href="https://lettingagentregistration.gov.scot/">check if the letting agent you use (or are thinking of using) is allowed to carry out letting agency work</a>.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <p>If they're a registered letting agent, they'll have a unique letting agent registration number that they must put on all their communications and advertising. You can&nbsp;use this number to check whether they're registered. You can also search the Register using the letting agent's name.</p>

              <h2>Refused and revoked agents</h2>

              <p>If the Scottish Ministers are not satisfied that an agent meets the requirements to be registered, they must refuse to add them to the Register or, if they are already on the Register but no longer meet the requirements, revoke their registration.</p>

              <p>Where the Scottish Ministers refuse to enter an agent in the Register or revoke an agent’s existing entry, this fact will be shown on the Register for 12 months after the date of&nbsp;final refusal.</p>

              <p>You can <a href="https://register.lettingagentregistration.gov.scot/refused-and-revoked">check the Register for a list of refused and revoked agents</a>.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>Once an agent’s registration has been refused or revoked, they cannot get back any costs or charges incurred relating to letting agency work carried out in the period after the date their registration was refused or revoked.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <h2>Removed agents</h2>

              <p>Agents must renew their Registration every 3 years. Agents will be taken off the Register if they do not renew their registration before the deadline, or if Scottish Ministers decide the agent is no longer carrying out letting agency work. You can <a href="letting-agents-removed-register">check the list of agents</a> who have been removed from the Register for these reasons.</p>

              <div class="ds_warning-text__text">
              <p>Landlords should not use a letting agent who isn't on the Register, or an agent whose registration has been removed, refused or revoked.</p>

              <h2>If you have a problem with your letting agent</h2>

              <p>If you're a landlord and you have a letting agent managing your property, there are a number of things you can do if you aren't happy with their work.</p>

              <h3>Check your contract</h3>

              <p>The first thing you should do is look at the 'terms of business' or business contract you have with your letting agent. The Code of Practice says that agents must agree with the landlord what services they will provide and give the landlord a copy of the agreement.</p>

              <p>This should give details of the agreement you made with your agent on how they'll manage your property.</p>

              <p>It will explain the services the agent will carry out for you, as well as how much authority they have to act on your behalf without checking with you first.</p>

              <div class="ds_inset-text">
              <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
              <p>If there's a certain part of your letting agent's services you're unhappy with, you may want to ask them for their policy or procedure for that specific service.</p>
              </div>
              </div>

              <p>The Code says that all agents must have specific procedures for a number of different parts of their work.</p>

              <h3>Check the Code of Practice</h3>

              <p>Your letting agent has to follow the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/lettingagentcodeofpractice">Letting Agent Code of Practice</a> from 31 January 2018.</p>

              <p>If you are not&nbsp;happy with the way they're carrying out certain work on your behalf, check what the Code says about that service.</p>

              <p>If your agent has failed to do what the Code says is required of them, you can make a formal complaint.</p>

              <h3>Make a formal complaint</h3>

              <p>You can make a formal complaint to your letting agent if you believe they've failed to either:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>do what they agreed to in their 'terms of business' or business contract, or</li>
               <li>follow the rules of the Letting Agent Code of Practice</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The Code says that all agents must have a written complaints procedure. If you don't know your agent's procedure, they should be able to give you it.</p>

              <p>Your complaint should be in writing, and you will need to give the agent a reasonable amount of time to respond.</p>

              </div>
              </div>

              <h3>Apply to the housing tribunal</h3>

              <p>If you think your letting agent has failed to comply with the Code of Practice and you can't resolve the problem with them through their complaints procedure (or they don't respond within a reasonable time), you can take your complaint further.</p>

              <p>A subtenant is a person who is renting a property, or section of a property, from your tenant.</p>

              <p>If your subtenant started renting from your tenant on or after 1 December 2017, they're likely to have a private residential tenancy.</p>

              <p>If the tenancy agreement started before 1 December 2017 they do not have a private residential tenancy and you should not use this notice (unless the tenancy was converted to a private residential tenancy on or after 1 December 2017).</p>

              <h2>Asking your subtenant to leave</h2>

              <p>By law, you can only ask your subtenant to leave for one of these reasons:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>you want to sell the property you're renting out</li>
               <li>the mortgage lender has repossessed your property and is selling it</li>
               <li>you want to carry out work to the property which means no one will be able to live there while the work is carried out</li>
               <li>you want to live in the property</li>
               <li>someone in your family is going to move into the property</li>
               <li>you no longer want to use the property as a place where someone lives. For example, if you want to use it as a business or an office</li>
               <li>you need your property for a religious purpose. For example, if a priest or imam is going to live there</li>
               <li>you have had your landlord registration refused or revoked</li>
               <li>your House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licence has been revoked by your local council</li>
               <li>an overcrowding statutory notice has been served on you</li>
               <li>your tenant has stopped being employed by you, or you thought they were going to be employed by you but this is no longer the case</li>
               <li>your property provides supported accommodation but your subtenant no longer needs help</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How to use a 'Subtenant Notice to Leave'</h2>

              <p>By giving your subtenant a Notice to Leave, you are telling them:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>that they must leave the property</li>
               <li>the date they should leave the property by</li>
               <li>why you are asking them to leave (also known as grounds)</li>
              </ul>

              <p>If you're asking your subtenant to leave for one of the reasons above, it will be because you are asking your tenant (likely to be your subtenant's landlord) to leave at the same time.</p>

              <h3>Notice period</h3>

              <p>You'll need to give your subtenant the right amount of time to leave the property and tell them under which grounds you are asking them to leave. The amount of time a subtenant is given before they must leave a property is called 'notice'.</p>

              <p>The amount of notice you must give your tenant will depend on the eviction ground used. The notice period will either be 6 months or 3 months.</p>

              <p>Grounds that require 6 months' notice are the:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>landlord intends to sell the property</li>
               <li>property is to be sold by the mortgage lender</li>
               <li>landlord intends to refurbish the Let Property</li>
               <li>landlord intends to use the Let Property for a non-residential purpose</li>
               <li>property is required for a religious purpose</li>
               <li>tenant ceases to be - or fails to become - an employee</li>
               <li>tenant no longer needs supported accommodation</li>
               <li>landlord has served an overcrowding statutory notice</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Grounds that require 3 months' notice are the:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>landlord intends to live in the property</li>
               <li>landlord's family member intends to live in the property</li>
               <li>landlord has had their registration refused or revoked</li>
               <li>landlord's HMO licence has been revoked or renewal has been refused</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Giving the notice to your tenant</h3>

              <p>If you give your subtenant this notice by recorded post or by email, you will need to delay the start date of the notice period by 2 days to give your tenant time to receive it. For example, you may send a Notice to Leave on the 1st of June which tells the tenant that their notice period begins on the 3rd of June.</p>

              <p>Should you choose to deliver the notice by hand, you do not need to delay the start of the notice period.</p>

              <p>You should attach a copy of your tenant's Notice to Leave to the Subtenant Notice to Leave which you give your subtenant.</p>

              <p>If the subtenant's behaviour is the cause of them being asked to leave (for example, if they are behaving antisocially), it is the responsibility of the subtenant's landlord (your tenant or mid-tenant) to serve them with a Notice to Leave. This is not something you can do if you are the head landlord.</p>

              <h3>Refusing to leave the property</h3>

              <p>If your subtenant ignores the Notice to Leave or refuses to leave the property you can apply to the <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/apply-tribunal">First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber</a> to issue an eviction notice.</p>

              <h2>Create a 'Subtenant Notice to Leave'</h2>

              <p>To complete the form you will need::</p>

              <ul>
               <li>details about your grounds for asking a subtenant to leave.</li>
               <li>evidence to support these details, if you have it.</li>
               <li>your subtenant's details. If you're evicting joint subtenants you can add their names to the same Subtenants Notice to Leave. If you're evicting any subtenants who aren't on the same tenancy agreement you will have to give each subtenant their own Notice to Leave. This means you will have to complete this form more than once.</li>
               <li>the end of the notice period. This means the last date before your subtenant must leave.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>A subtenant is a person who is renting a property, or section of a property, from your tenant.</p>

              <p>If your subtenant started renting from your tenant on or after 1 December 2017, they're likely to have a private residential tenancy.</p>

              <p>If the tenancy agreement started before 1 December 2017 they do not have a private residential tenancy and you should not use this notice (unless the tenancy was converted to a private residential tenancy on or after 1 December 2017).</p>

              <h2>Asking your subtenant to leave</h2>

              <p>By law, you can only ask your subtenant to leave for one of these reasons:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>you want to sell the property you're renting out</li>
               <li>the mortgage lender has repossessed your property and is selling it</li>
               <li>you want to carry out work to the property which means no one will be able to live there while the work is carried out</li>
               <li>you want to live in the property</li>
               <li>someone in your family is going to move into the property</li>
               <li>you no longer want to use the property as a place where someone lives. For example, if you want to use it as a business or an office</li>
               <li>you need your property for a religious purpose. For example, if a priest or imam is going to live there</li>
               <li>you have had your landlord registration refused or revoked</li>
               <li>your House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licence has been revoked by your local council</li>
               <li>an overcrowding statutory notice has been served on you</li>
               <li>your tenant has stopped being employed by you, or you thought they were going to be employed by you but this is no longer the case</li>
               <li>your property provides supported accommodation but your subtenant no longer needs help</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How to use a 'Subtenant Notice to Leave'</h2>

              <p>By giving your subtenant a Notice to Leave, you are telling them:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>that they must leave the property</li>
               <li>the date they should leave the property by</li>
               <li>why you are asking them to leave (also known as grounds)</li>
              </ul>

              <p>If you're asking your subtenant to leave for one of the reasons above, it will be because you are asking your tenant (likely to be your subtenant's landlord) to leave at the same time.</p>

              <h3>Notice period</h3>

              <p>You'll need to give your subtenant the right amount of time to leave the property and tell them under which grounds you are asking them to leave. The amount of time a subtenant is given before they must leave a property is called 'notice'.</p>

              <p>The amount of notice you must give your tenant will depend on the eviction ground used. The notice period will either be 6 months or 3 months.</p>

              <p>Grounds that require 6 months' notice are the:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>landlord intends to sell the property</li>
               <li>property is to be sold by the mortgage lender</li>
               <li>landlord intends to refurbish the Let Property</li>
               <li>landlord intends to use the Let Property for a non-residential purpose</li>
               <li>property is required for a religious purpose</li>
               <li>tenant ceases to be - or fails to become - an employee</li>
               <li>tenant no longer needs supported accommodation</li>
               <li>landlord has served an overcrowding statutory notice</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Grounds that require 3 months' notice are the:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>landlord intends to live in the property</li>
               <li>landlord's family member intends to live in the property</li>
               <li>landlord has had their registration refused or revoked</li>
               <li>landlord's HMO licence has been revoked or renewal has been refused</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Giving the notice to your tenant</h3>

              <p>If you give your subtenant this notice by recorded post or by email, you will need to delay the start date of the notice period by 2 days to give your tenant time to receive it. For example, you may send a Notice to Leave on the 1st of June which tells the tenant that their notice period begins on the 3rd of June.</p>

              <p>Should you choose to deliver the notice by hand, you do not need to delay the start of the notice period.</p>

              <p>You should attach a copy of your tenant's Notice to Leave to the Subtenant Notice to Leave which you give your subtenant.</p>

              <p>If the subtenant's behaviour is the cause of them being asked to leave (for example, if they are behaving antisocially), it is the responsibility of the subtenant's landlord (your tenant or mid-tenant) to serve them with a Notice to Leave. This is not something you can do if you are the head landlord.</p>

              <h3>Refusing to leave the property</h3>

              <p>If your subtenant ignores the Notice to Leave or refuses to leave the property you can apply to the <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/apply-tribunal">First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber</a> to issue an eviction notice.</p>

               <li>the mortgage lender has repossessed your property and is selling it</li>
               <li>you want to carry out work to the property which means no one will be able to live there while the work is carried out</li>
               <li>you want to live in the property</li>
               <li>someone in your family is going to move into the property</li>
               <li>you no longer want to use the property as a place where someone lives. For example, if you want to use it as a business or an office</li>
               <li>you need your property for a religious purpose. For example, if a priest or imam is going to live there</li>
               <li>you have had your landlord registration refused or revoked</li>
               <li>your House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licence has been revoked by your local council</li>
               <li>an overcrowding statutory notice has been served on you</li>
               <li>your tenant has stopped being employed by you, or you thought they were going to be employed by you but this is no longer the case</li>
               <li>your property provides supported accommodation but your tenant no needs this service</li>
               <li>your tenant is no longer living in your property</li>
               <li>your tenant has breached a term(s) of their tenancy agreement</li>
               <li>your tenant is in rent arrears over three consecutive months</li>
               <li>your tenant has a criminal conviction - this ground only applies to certain crimes</li>
               <li>your tenant has been involved in antisocial behaviour - this ground only applies to certain antisocial behaviour</li>
               <li>your tenant has been with someone at the property who has a criminal conviction or has engaged in antisocial behaviour - only applies to certain crimes or antisocial behaviour</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How to use a 'Tenant Notice to Leave'</h2>

              <p>By giving your tenant a Notice to Leave, you are telling them:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>that they must leave the property</li>
               <li>the date they should leave the property by</li>
               <li>why you are asking them to leave (also known as grounds)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Notice period</h3>

              <p>You'll need to give your tenant the right amount of time to leave the property and tell them under which grounds you are asking them to leave. The amount of time a tenant is given before they must leave a property is called 'notice'.</p>

              <p>The amount of notice you need to give your tenant will either be 6 months, 3 months or 28 days. The amount of notice depends on the ground used.</p>

              <p>Grounds that require you to give 6 months' notice are:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>you want to sell the property you're renting out</li>
               <li>the mortgage lender has repossessed your property and is selling it</li>
               <li>you want to carry out work to the property which means no one will be able to live there while the work is carried out</li>
               <li>you no longer want to use the property as a place where someone lives, such as if you want to use it as a business or an office</li>
               <li>you need your property for a religious purpose, such as a priest or imam is going to live there</li>
               <li>your property provides supported accommodation but your tenant no needs this service</li>
               <li>your tenant has breached a term(s) of their tenancy agreement</li>
               <li>an overcrowding statutory notice has been served on you</li>
               <li>your tenant is in rent arrears over three consecutive months</li>
               <li>your tenant has stopped being employed by you, or you thought they were going to be employed by you but this is no longer the case</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Grounds that require you to give your tenant 3 months' notice are:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>you intend to live in the property</li>
               <li>someone in your family is going to move into the property</li>
               <li>you have had your landlord registration refused or revoked</li>
               <li>your House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licence has been revoked by your local council</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Grounds that require you to give your tenant 28 days' notice are:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>your tenant has a criminal conviction - this ground only applies to certain crimes</li>
               <li>your tenant has been involved in antisocial behaviour</li>
               <li>your tenant has been with someone at the property who has a criminal conviction or has engaged in antisocial behaviour</li>
               <li>your tenant is no longer living in your property.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Giving the notice to your tenant</h3>

              <p>If you give your tenant this notice by recorded post or by email, you will need to delay the start date of the notice period by 2 days to give your tenant time to receive it. For example, you may send a Notice to Leave on the 1st of June which tells the tenant that their notice period begins on the 3rd of June.</p>

              <p>Should you choose to have a Sheriff Officer deliver the notice by hand, you do not need to delay the start of the notice period.</p>

              <h3>Subtenants</h3>

              <p>If you also want to evict a subtenant you'll need to use the <a href="tell-your-subtenant-they-need-to-leave">'Subtenants Notice to Leave'.</a> You'll need to include a copy of your tenant's Notice to Leave with the notice which you give to your subtenant.</p>

              <h3>Refusing to leave the property</h3>

              <p>If your tenant ignores the Notice to Leave or refuses to leave the property, you can apply to the <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/apply-tribunal">First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber</a> to issue an eviction notice. If your tenant was given:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>6 months' notice - you can contact the Tribunal from the day after the 6 month period has passed</li>
               <li>3 months' notice - you can contact the Tribunal from the day after the 3 month period has passed</li>
               <li>28 days' notice - you can contact the tribunal from day 29</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Create a 'Tenant Notice to Leave'</h2>

              <p>To complete the form you will need:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>details about your <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/private-residential-tenancies-landlords-guide/pages/grounds-for-eviction/">grounds for asking a tenant to leave.</a></li>
               <li>evidence to support these details, if you have it.</li>
               <li>your tenant's details. If you're evicting joint tenants you can add their names to the same Notice to Leave. If you're evicting any tenants who aren't on the same tenancy agreement you will have to give each tenant their own Notice to Leave. This means you will have to complete this form more than once.</li>
               <li>the end of the notice period. This means the last date before your tenant must leave.</li>
              </ul>

               <li>that they must leave the property</li>
               <li>the date they should leave the property by</li>
               <li>why you are asking them to leave (also known as grounds)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Notice period</h3>

              <p>You'll need to give your tenant the right amount of time to leave the property and tell them under which grounds you are asking them to leave. The amount of time a tenant is given before they must leave a property is called 'notice'.</p>

              <p>The amount of notice you need to give your tenant will either be 6 months, 3 months or 28 days. The amount of notice depends on the ground used.</p>

              <p>Grounds that require you to give 6 months' notice are:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>you want to sell the property you're renting out</li>
               <li>the mortgage lender has repossessed your property and is selling it</li>
               <li>you want to carry out work to the property which means no one will be able to live there while the work is carried out</li>
               <li>you no longer want to use the property as a place where someone lives, such as if you want to use it as a business or an office</li>
               <li>you need your property for a religious purpose, such as a priest or imam is going to live there</li>
               <li>your property provides supported accommodation but your tenant no needs this service</li>
               <li>your tenant has breached a term(s) of their tenancy agreement</li>
               <li>an overcrowding statutory notice has been served on you</li>
               <li>your tenant is in rent arrears over three consecutive months</li>
               <li>your tenant has stopped being employed by you, or you thought they were going to be employed by you but this is no longer the case</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Grounds that require you to give your tenant 3 months' notice are:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>you intend to live in the property</li>
               <li>someone in your family is going to move into the property</li>
               <li>you have had your landlord registration refused or revoked</li>
               <li>your House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licence has been revoked by your local council</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Grounds that require you to give your tenant 28 days' notice are:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>your tenant has a criminal conviction - this ground only applies to certain crimes</li>
               <li>your tenant has been involved in antisocial behaviour</li>
               <li>your tenant has been with someone at the property who has a criminal conviction or has engaged in antisocial behaviour</li>
               <li>your tenant is no longer living in your property.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Giving the notice to your tenant</h3>

              <p>If you give your tenant this notice by recorded post or by email, you will need to delay the start date of the notice period by 2 days to give your tenant time to receive it. For example, you may send a Notice to Leave on the 1st of June which tells the tenant that their notice period begins on the 3rd of June.</p>

              <p>Should you choose to have a Sheriff Officer deliver the notice by hand, you do not need to delay the start of the notice period.</p>

              <h3>Subtenants</h3>

              <p>If you also want to evict a subtenant you'll need to use the <a href="tell-your-subtenant-they-need-to-leave">'Subtenants Notice to Leave'.</a> You'll need to include a copy of your tenant's Notice to Leave with the notice which you give to your subtenant.</p>

              <h3>Refusing to leave the property</h3>

              <p>If your tenant ignores the Notice to Leave or refuses to leave the property, you can apply to the <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/apply-tribunal">First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber</a> to issue an eviction notice. If your tenant was given:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>6 months' notice - you can contact the Tribunal from the day after the 6 month period has passed</li>
               <li>3 months' notice - you can contact the Tribunal from the day after the 3 month period has passed</li>
               <li>28 days' notice - you can contact the tribunal from day 29</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Create a 'Tenant Notice to Leave'</h2>

              <p>To complete the form you will need:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>details about your <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/private-residential-tenancies-landlords-guide/pages/grounds-for-eviction/">grounds for asking a tenant to leave.</a></li>
               <li>evidence to support these details, if you have it.</li>
               <li>your tenant's details. If you're evicting joint tenants you can add their names to the same Notice to Leave. If you're evicting any tenants who aren't on the same tenancy agreement you will have to give each tenant their own Notice to Leave. This means you will have to complete this form more than once.</li>
               <li>the end of the notice period. This means the last date before your tenant must leave.</li>

                \ their home, there are a number of steps you have to take.</p> \n\
                \  <p>You have to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"registration\"\
                >register</a> with the local council – where your let property is\
                \ located</li> \n   <li>understand your <a href=\"your-responsibilities\"\

                >the right paperwork</a></li> \n   <li>know the law on <a href=\"\
                tenancy-deposits-and-moving-in\">tenancy deposits</a> (the deposit\
                \ must be lodged with a third party scheme within 30 working days\
                \ of the tenancy starting)</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you're thinking\
                \ about renting out your home, you might want to consider <a href=\"\

                \ \n  <p>If you're renting out a room in a property for someone to\
                \ live in as their home while you're living there, the rules may be\
                \ different. These types of tenancies are sometimes called 'common\
                \ law' tenancies or 'occupancy agreements'. You can <a href=\"https://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/advice_topics/renting_rights/common_law_tenancies/about_common_law_tenancy_rights\"\

                \ If you use a different tenancy agreement, it is important that you\
                \ make sure it contains everything that it should under the law. </p>\
                \ \n  <p>If you do not give your tenant these things, they can apply\
                \ to the First-Tier Tribunal for a 'payment order'. If a payment order\
                \ is awarded, you will have to pay your tenant. How much you'll have\
                \ to pay depends on what you haven't given your tenant, but it can\
                \ be up to the value of 6 months' rent.</p> \n  <p>You can use the\
                \ model tenancy agreement form to <a href=\"create-a-tenancy-agreement\"\

              \ out your property, you may want to take a deposit from your new tenant\
              \ before they move in.</p> \n  <p>A deposit is a sum of money which\
              \ acts as a guarantee against:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>damage to the property</li>\
              \ \n   <li>cleaning bills if the property is left in poor condition</li>\
              \ \n   <li>bills that are left unpaid, like fuel or telephone bills</li>\
              \ \n   <li>unpaid rent</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If any of the above happens,\
              \ the deposit can be used to cover costs so you do not have to pay them.</p>\
              \ \n  <p>If there are no issues when the tenant moves out, their deposit\
              \ should be paid back to them in full.</p> \n  <div class=\"ds_inset-text\"\

              \ be charged as a deposit cannot be more than two months' rent. For\
              \ example, if the rent is £500 a month, you cannot ask for more than\
              \ a £1000 deposit.</p> \n   </div>\n  </div> \n  <h2 id=\"tenancy-deposit-schemes\"\
              >Tenancy deposit schemes</h2> \n  <p>Once your new tenant has paid the\
              \ deposit for the property, you have to lodge it with a tenancy deposit\
              \ scheme within 30 working days of the tenancy starting.</p> \n  <p>There\
              \ are three tenancy deposit scheme providers to choose from in Scotland:</p>\
              \ \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"http://www.lettingprotectionscotland.com/\"\

              >my|deposits Scotland</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Once you register the\
              \ deposit with one of these providers, you have to give written information\
              \ to your tenant:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>the amount of the deposit and\
              \ the date you received it</li> \n   <li>the date the deposit was paid\
              \ into the tenancy deposit scheme</li> \n   <li>the address of the property</li>\
              \ \n   <li>a statement confirming you're registered (or have applied\
              \ to be registered) as a landlord for the property with the local council\
              \ that covers the area where your let property is located</li> \n  \
              \ <li>the name and contact details of the tenancy deposit scheme provider\
              \ you used</li> \n   <li>the circumstances in which all or part of your\
              \ deposit may be kept at the end of the tenancy</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If\
              \ your tenant has an arrangement with you to pay their deposit in instalments,\
              \ you must give them this information in writing for each instalment.</p>\

              \ you do not use a tenancy deposit scheme your tenant can apply to the\
              \ First-Tier Tribunal for Scotland (Housing and Property Chamber), either\
              \ during the tenancy or up to three months after it ends. The Tribunal\
              \ can order you to pay up to 3 times the deposit to your tenant.\n \
              \  </div> \n  </div> \n  <h3 id=\"exceptions\">Exceptions</h3> \n  <p>There\
              \ are some circumstances where you do not have to use a tenancy deposit\
              \ scheme. You do not need to register a deposit if:</p> \n  <ul> \n\
              \   <li>you return the full deposit to the tenant within 30 working\
              \ days of the beginning of the tenancy</li> \n   <li>the landlord and\
              \ tenant are family members</li> \n   <li>the tenancy is a 'liferent'\
              \ which means the tenant has 'a formal right to use the property during\
              \ their lifetime'</li> \n   <li>the property is a holiday home</li>\
              \ \n   <li>the property is used by a religious organisation</li> \n\
              \   <li>the property is supported accommodation</li> \n   <li>it's an\
              \ agricultural or crofting tenancy</li> \n   <li>you're also a resident\
              \ in the property</li> \n   <li>the property is subject to control orders</li>\
              \ \n   <li>transitory ownership – where ownership of a house is short-term,\
              \ e.g. a house which has been repossessed by a mortgage lender or a\
              \ house held for up to 6 months by executors dealing with a deceased\
              \ person's estate</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2 id=\"returning-the-deposit\"\
              >Returning the deposit</h2> \n  <p>When a tenancy ends you have to get\
              \ in touch with the tenancy deposit scheme provider and ask for the\
              \ deposit to be returned.</p> \n  <p>You should tell the provider how\
              \ much of the deposit should go back to the tenant and, if there are\
              \ any repairs or cleaning work to be done, how much of it should go\
              \ to you to cover these costs.</p> \n  <p>The provider will then ask\
              \ the tenant if they agree with the amount to be returned to them. They\
              \ have to write back within 30 working days to confirm whether they\
              \ agree or disagree.</p> \n  <p>If they don't reply, their share of\
              \ the deposit will stay in the scheme and you'll get your share.</p>\
              \ \n  <p>If you are not due any money from the deposit, let the tenancy\
              \ deposit scheme know as soon as possible, so the tenant can be repaid\
              \ quickly.</p> \n  <h2 id=\"deposit-disputes\">Deposit disputes</h2>\
              \ \n  <p>At the end of a tenancy, a landlord and tenant should always\
              \ try to agree on any deductions from a tenant's deposit. If agreements\
              \ can't be reached, the schemes offer a free dispute resolution service\
              \ where an independent adjudicator looks at evidence from both tenant\
              \ and landlord within specified timescales. </p> \n  <h3 id=\"making-a-decision\"\
              >Making a decision</h3> \n  <p>They make a decision on how the deposit\
              \ should be returned. It's usually the landlord (or agent) who submits\
              \ a repayment proposal, but the tenant can make an application too.</p>\

              \ receive a complaint of antisocial behaviour. These include:</p> \n\
              \  <ul> \n   <li>directly from the neighbours – your contact details\
              \ are publicly available once you register as a landlord</li> \n   <li>from\

              \ (if the neighbour has contacted them)</li> \n   <li>from the tenants\

              \ to your tenants</h2> \n  <p>When you receive a complaint about your\
              \ tenants or their visitors, there are a number of steps you can take\
              \ to resolve the issue. These include:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>sending\
              \ them a letter, explaining what you've been told and asking them to\
              \ change their behaviour</li> \n   <li>arranging a time to visit them\
              \ and discuss the problem</li> \n   <li>finding out the circumstances,\
              \ understanding what the issue is and what the options are to fix it</li>\
              \ \n   <li>agreeing with your tenants what will change, recording it\
              \ in writing and making sure you and your tenants both have a copy</li>\
              \ \n   <li>keeping a log of what steps you've taken, in case you need\
              \ to prove later that you've tried to resolve it</li> \n  </ul> \n \
              \ <p>If the complaint is about noise, your tenant may be able to reach\
              \ a compromise arrangement with a neighbour. Read more information on\

              feeding-back-to-the-complainant\">Feeding back to the complainant</h2>\
              \ \n  <p>Once you've spoken to the tenant to try to sort out the issue,\
              \ you should try to get in touch with whomever complained to let them\
              \ know.</p> \n  <p>If you have the name and contact details of the person\
              \ who complained, get in touch with them and tell them what steps you've\
              \ taken.</p> \n  <p>If you don't know their name because the complaint\
              \ came through the council, you should ask the council to tell them\
              \ on your behalf.</p> \n  <p>You should also decide if there's anyone\
              \ else you want to inform that you're dealing with the complaint. If\
              \ a neighbour made the complaint, it's possible that others are annoyed\
              \ but haven't put a complaint in. By telling other neighbours what you've\
              \ done, it might stop you getting more complaints from them.</p> \n\
              \  <h2 id=\"if-the-complaints-continue\">If the complaints continue</h2>\
              \ \n  <p>If you keep getting complaints after you've tried to resolve\
              \ the situation with the tenant, you should consider what to do next.</p>\
              \ \n  <p>Your options include:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>talking to your\
              \ tenants again and telling them there are still issues</li> \n   <li>asking\
              \ the council to apply for an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) for\
              \ the tenants or their visitors</li> \n   <li>going to court to get\
              \ an interdict to prevent your tenants behaving in a certain way</li>\
              \ \n   <li>evicting your tenants</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you don't\
              \ do anything to stop your tenants' antisocial behaviour, the council\
              \ can take action. This can start with an antisocial behaviour notice\
              \ (ASBN), which tells you as the landlord what you have to do to stop\
              \ the problem. It may also affect your <a href=\"https://www.landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk/about\"\

                \ landlords will now need to give tenants 6 months' notice, unless\
                \ they are ending the tenancy for certain reasons. This includes antisocial\
                \ and criminal behaviour and where the landlord or their family need\
                \ to move into the property.</p> \n  <p>The new law also temporarily\
                \ makes all grounds for eviction in the private rented sector discretionary.\
                \ This means that even if the Tribunal agrees that the ground exists,\
                \ it still has to decide whether it is reasonable to issue an eviction\
                \ order. </p> \n  <p>This change ensures that the Tribunal will be\
                \ able to use discretion and take into account all factors relating\
                \ to the impact of coronavirus on both the landlord and tenant, before\
                \ deciding whether to issue an eviction order or not.</p> \n  <p>The\
                \ new law applies if you are serving notice on your tenant on or after\
                \ 7 April 2020. If you serve notice on your tenant before 7 April\
                \ 2020, the changes in the new law do not apply.</p> \n </body>\n\

                \ 7 April 2020. After 3 October 2020 further changes were made reducing\
                \ the notice period for antisocial or criminal behaviour related grounds.\

                >Scottish Government website</a> as read only downloads. The website\

                \ your tenant a Notice to Leave and they do not move out as soon as\
                \ the notice period ends, you can apply to the <a href=\"https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/\"\
                >First-tier Tribunal for Scotland (Housing and Property Chamber)</a>\
                \ ('the Tribunal' for short) for an eviction order. You must do this\
                \ within six months of the date you gave to your tenant in the Notice\
                \ to Leave.</p> \n  <p>Before submitting an application to the Tribunal\
                \ for an eviction order, you must inform the local authority of your\
                \ intention to apply to the Tribunal. There is a certain notice you\
                \ must use for this. You can get this by contacting your local authority\
                \ or looking on their website.</p> \n  <p>When you apply for an eviction\
                \ order you must give the Tribunal a copy of the Notice to Leave you\
                \ gave the tenant, stating which of the 18 grounds for eviction you\
                \ are using. You will also have to give the Tribunal evidence to support\
                \ the eviction ground you are using. </p> \n  <p>The Tribunal will\
                \ consider your case and decide whether the eviction ground exists.\
                \ If you're relying on a mandatory eviction ground and the Tribunal\
                \ is satisfied that the ground exists, they must grant you an eviction\
                \ order.</p> \n  <p>If you're relying on a discretionary eviction\
                \ ground, even if the Tribunal is satisfied that the ground exists,\
                \ it will consider whether it is reasonable to grant you an eviction\
                \ order. </p> \n  <div class=\"ds_inset-text\"> \n   <div class=\"\
                ds_inset-text__text\">\n     The new law temporarily makes all grounds\
                \ for eviction in the private rented sector discretionary. This means\
                \ that even if the Tribunal agrees that the ground exists, it still\
                \ has to decide whether it is reasonable to issue an eviction order.\
                \ This change ensures that the Tribunal will be able to use discretion\
                \ and take into account all factors relating to the impact coronavirus\
                \ has had on both the landlord and tenant, before deciding whether\
                \ to issue an eviction order or not. This change only applies if you\
                \ serve notice on your tenant on or after 7 April 2020. \n   </div>\
                \ \n  </div> \n  <p>If a tenant has left the property and thinks they\
                \ have been misled into leaving the property, they can apply to the\
                \ Tribunal for a 'wrongful termination order'. The Tribunal may make\
                \ a wrongful termination order if it decides that the landlord:</p>\
                \ \n  <ul> \n   <li>misled the Tribunal into giving an eviction order\
                \ it should not have</li> \n   <li>misled the tenant into leaving\
                \ the property.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>An example of a possible wrongful\
                \ termination would be where the landlord serves notice to leave on\
                \ the tenant on the ground that they intend to sell the property,\
                \ but then does not sell the property and instead lets it out to another\
                \ tenant.</p> \n  <p>If a wrongful termination order is issued, the\
                \ landlord will be told to pay the tenant a payment of no more than\
                \ six months' rent. The local council will also be told about the\
                \ order being made and will take this into account when deciding if\
                \ the landlord is a 'fit and proper' person registered to be a landlord.</p>\

              \ – how quickly maintenance staff will be at the property, how they'll\

              hippostd:content: |-
                <p>As part of the Code of Practice, you need to make sure that you have professional indemnity insurance.</p>

                <p>If you also <a href="/letting-agent-registration/professional-indemnity-insurance-and-protecting-client-money/#client-money">hold and handle client money</a>, you will also need to make sure that you have:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>one, or more, separate and dedicated client accounts</li>
                 <li>client money protection insurance</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is to make sure that your client's money is protected, and your business is protected if it has to defend itself following a claim.</p>

                <p>The Code came into force on 31 January 2018 and you must meet the standards of practice set out in the Code.</p>

                <h2>Professional indemnity insurance</h2>

                <p>If a client is not happy with the service you provided or you made a mistake which cost them money, they might want to pursue you for compensation.</p>

                <p>The Code requires you to get professional indemnity insurance. This helps protect you from claims by dissatisfied clients by covering the cost of compensation for loss or damage caused by your business.</p>

                <p>Cover must be on a 'full civil liability' basis, and it should be 'retroactive' if possible.</p>

                <p>Retroactive cover means the insurance protects you from claims for work carried out in the past, before the policy started.</p>

                <h2>If you do not hold and handle client money</h2>

                <p>If you do not hold and handle client money you will not need to have a dedicated client account or client money protection insurance.</p>

                <p>For example, this means you do not do any of the following on behalf of landlords and tenants:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>hold, handle or collect rent</li>
                 <li>take and lodge deposits</li>
                 <li>hold and handle money for repairs and maintenance</li>
                </ul>

                <div>&nbsp;</div>

                <h2>If you do hold and handle client money</h2>

                <p>If you do hold and handle client money you will need to have a dedicated client account or client money protection insurance.</p>

                <h3>Separate client account</h3>

                <p>One of the requirements of the Code is that you need to hold client money in one or more separate bank accounts.</p>

                <p>The client account must:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>be separate from your main business or private accounts</li>
                 <li>only contain your clients' money and nothing else</li>
                 <li>be held with a bank or building society authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Code also needs you to have written confirmation from your bank or building society that:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>all the money in the account is client money, and</li>
                 <li>the bank or building society is not entitled to combine the account with any other account</li>
                 <li>the bank or building society cannot take money from that account if you owe them money from any of your other accounts</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Client money protection insurance</h3>

                <p>Another requirement of the Code is that you need to have client money protection insurance.</p>

                <p>This is a special type of insurance that protects the money of landlords and tenants in case the owners of the letting agency steal or misuse it.</p>

                <p>This money is usually tenants' and landlords' rental payments, but can also include money held for repairs and maintenance.</p>

                <p>There are a number of different ways you can get client money protection insurance, including becoming a member of an industry/professional body, or through a specialist insurance broker.</p>

                <p>The industry and professional bodies with client money protection insurance are:</p>

                <p>As part of the Code of Practice, you need to make sure that you have professional indemnity insurance.</p>

                <p>If you also <a href="/letting-agent-registration/professional-indemnity-insurance-and-protecting-client-money/#client-money">hold and handle client money</a>, you will also need to make sure that you have:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>one, or more, separate and dedicated client accounts</li>
                 <li>client money protection insurance</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is to make sure that your client's money is protected, and your business is protected if it has to defend itself following a claim.</p>

                <p>The Code came into force on 31 January 2018 and you must meet the standards of practice set out in the Code.</p>

                <h2>Professional indemnity insurance</h2>

                <p>If a client is not happy with the service you provided or you made a mistake which cost them money, they might want to pursue you for compensation.</p>

                <p>The Code requires you to get professional indemnity insurance. This helps protect you from claims by dissatisfied clients by covering the cost of compensation for loss or damage caused by your business.</p>

                <p>Cover must be on a 'full civil liability' basis, and it should be 'retroactive' if possible.</p>

                <p>Retroactive cover means the insurance protects you from claims for work carried out in the past, before the policy started.</p>

                <h2>If you do not hold and handle client money</h2>

                <p>If you do not hold and handle client money you will not need to have a dedicated client account or client money protection insurance.</p>

                <p>For example, this means you do not do any of the following on behalf of landlords and tenants:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>hold, handle or collect rent</li>
                 <li>take and lodge deposits</li>
                 <li>hold and handle money for repairs and maintenance</li>
                </ul>

                <div>&nbsp;</div>

                <h2>If you do hold and handle client money</h2>

                <p>If you do hold and handle client money you will need to have a dedicated client account or client money protection insurance.</p>

                <h3>Separate client account</h3>

                <p>One of the requirements of the Code is that you need to hold client money in one or more separate bank accounts.</p>

                <p>The client account must:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>be separate from your main business or private accounts</li>
                 <li>only contain your clients' money and nothing else</li>
                 <li>be held with a bank or building society authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Code also needs you to have written confirmation from your bank or building society that:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>all the money in the account is client money, and</li>
                 <li>the bank or building society is not entitled to combine the account with any other account</li>
                 <li>the bank or building society cannot take money from that account if you owe them money from any of your other accounts</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Client money protection insurance</h3>

                <p>Another requirement of the Code is that you need to have client money protection insurance.</p>

                <p>This is a special type of insurance that protects the money of landlords and tenants in case the owners of the letting agency steal or misuse it.</p>

                <p>This money is usually tenants' and landlords' rental payments, but can also include money held for repairs and maintenance.</p>

                <p>There are a number of different ways you can get client money protection insurance, including becoming a member of an industry/professional body, or through a specialist insurance broker.</p>

                <p>The industry and professional bodies with client money protection insurance are:</p>

                <p>You cannot carry out letting agency work until Scottish Ministers approve your registration.</p>

                <p>If you are already registered, you must submit an application to renew an existing registration before your current registration expires. If your current registration expires, you cannot continue to carry out letting agent work.</p>

                <p>If you do, you will be committing a criminal offence. If you're convicted, you could face a fine of up to £50,000, up to 6 months imprisonment or both.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Before you apply for registration, or to renew your existing registration, those in your company who must do training, must have completed this. You will not be accepted onto the register, or have your existing registration renewed, if the <a href="/letting-agent-registration/training-and-qualifications/#relevant-qualification">minimum level of training</a> has not been met.</p>

                <p>Your business must also have <a href="professional-indemnity-insurance-and-protecting-client-money">adequate insurance</a> in place and hold the correct type of bank account where your business <a href="/letting-agent-registration/professional-indemnity-insurance-and-protecting-client-money/#client-money">holds or handles client money</a>.</p>

                <p>You can read information on <a href="how-to-apply">how to apply</a> and <a href="application-fee">on application fees</a>.</p>

                <h2>If your application is refused</h2>

                <p>If Scottish Ministers are thinking of refusing your application, they will let you know and tell you why.</p>

                <p>You'll have the right to 'make written representations' (argue your case in writing) to Scottish Ministers before the date they specify.</p>

                <p>If they still refuse the application after this, they will let you know and tell you why.</p>

                <p>You then have a right to appeal to the <a href="https://www.housingandpropertychamber.scot/">First-tier Tribunal for Scotland (Housing and Property Chamber)</a>. You must lodge your appeal within 21 days of being told your application was refused.</p>

                <p>If the Tribunal agrees with you, they may order Scottish Ministers to enter you in the register.</p>

              <p>The low income levels are different if you do not pay rent or a mortgage. For example, if you’re an adult living at home with your parents.</p>

              <p>For most single people who do not pay rent or a mortgage the monthly maximum personal earnings amount is £1608.75. This is the income before deductions of&nbsp;the individual person and not the household.</p>

              <p>Special circumstances can include if you:</p>

              <ul>
               <li>are disabled or a carer (or another household member is)</li>
               <li>have 2 or more children</li>
